 [ "Track 1<br> Hello and welcome to Complete Spanish. We're really excited about this new material, Language Transfer's first complete course, which is all you need to become a master self-directed language learner and steer yourself to fluency through practice of, and exposure to, Spanish; enjoying the fascinating journey of delving into language.<br>  Right after the first hour, you will be and feel like a Spanish speaker. With the thinking method, we are not just interested in teaching you Spanish in record time, but also about exploring the thinking processes, abilities, and habits which make us effective and confident language learners in control of our own learning process. This will give you a more intimate relationship with your new language and the greater ability to express yourself through the mechanisms that language offers.<br> We will reconstruct the language together in a way that will give you all of the know-how to overcome your technical difficulties in that language, so that you can concentrate on achieving and enjoying a freedom in your new language.<br> " ] ,
 [ "The course has been recorded with a volunteer student and is a genuine real life learning experience. The volunteer student does not have a script, and she's not acting. Recording in this way has allowed us to capture the essence of the learning experience with the thinking method. During the length of the course, I will be asking the volunteer student to perform various mental exercises, resulting in the construction of sentences. When I do so, you will pause the audio and complete the task yourself, and then continue listening to see how our volunteer student answered. It is important to understand that these are exercises and not tests.<br> Do not rush to answer. Take your time to think through your answer at your own pace, building it up piece by piece with the instructions you received during the audio, which are as much about the language as they are about the mental processes.<br> It is very important that you don't try to memorize anything. Memorization is an extremely distracting process, and I need you 100% here with us. If you need help getting over any anxiety about forgetting or the possibility of forgetting, then just remind yourself that you can always repeat the course at the end. So relax.<br> It's also important that you don't write anything down. You will carry around your new language in your head, not in a notebook. Some of the content you may forget, and that's ok. That's part of the design. Don't worry about that, and just concentrate on understanding (not memorizing) the explanations and building the sentences we give you.<br>  Find the time and place to do the audios where you are calm, undisturbed and can concentrate solely on your language learning experience. Using headphones should help you to tune out from the outside world and concentrate on this experience.<br> Try to be well rested when you do the courses. The tired mind makes all kinds of unproductive short cuts and careless mistakes. It is of the utmost importance that you don't just listen to the audios, even if you're listening and understanding the process, but that you pause every time I ask our volunteer student a question and work it out for yourself before hearing her response.<br> Otherwise you will not have your own language learning experience - you will just be witnessing somebody else's. If you do not pause and work out the answer for yourself before continuing, you will finish knowing a lot about Spanish but not speaking Spanish.<br> Sometimes our student takes one second to reply; sometimes 30 seconds or more. What we've done in the editing process is to leave a short pause for you to hit the pause button and then embark on your own mental journey before replying out loud and continuing with us.<br> " ] ,
 [ "The more energy you have, the more information you will naturally assimilate. If you find yourself tuning out during the explanations due to tiredness, then take a break and go back to it later. It's better to do little often than a lot all at once. So 20 minutes a day you will find much more effective than a few hours crammed in over the weekend. But of course you will find your own balance with other commitments and how quickly you wish to learn Spanish.<br> If it's been awhile since you've had to concentrate, then don't worry. You will notice your concentration span increase very rapidly. And remember: think slowly to learn quickly. This isn't at school where we expect your hand to go up straight away with the correct answer through memorization; this is a different process where you are expected to take the time to think your answer through and to appreciate and understand that it's those very processes of taking that time and thinking those answers through which makes us assimilate this new knowledge. You don't even have to worry about memorizing this advice, because it will be revisited many times during the course.<br> Not only are all the courses at Language Transfer available for free download, but we are also an unfunded and independent project. This allows us to create the best courses we can create, without external monetary or publicity pressures. Now, to maintain this freedom and to continue with the many plans we have in the pipeline for more audio courses and also textbooks, we really do need help with donations. So if you love the course and are in a position to donate, then please do. Many thanks for joining us, and let's begin.<br> -- end of track -- <br> " ]

 [" Track 2 <br> English and Spanish are two related languages. English is considered a Germanic language, but it's kind of half Latin. We have a huge amount of Latin vocabulary in English and this Latin vocabulary we can convert it over to Spanish really easily because Spanish is practically Modern Latin. <br >Whoever said Latin is a dead language lied. <br>Just in the same way that Greek is a modern version of ancient Greek, Spanish is like a modern version of Latin. It's actually a street Latin that became Spanish. <br>So we can identify Latin words in English, and we can, with just some rule or other, convert them over to Spanish, and this will give us around 3,000 words, I didn't count them, but there are around 3,000 words. <br>So for example, one of these rules is that words ending in -al tend to come from Latin, so we can make them Spanish. So to give you an example, normal in Spanish is 'normal'.  .. " ],
 [ " <span class='ans'>Normal</span><br>  Normal, good. What do you notice different between normal and normal? .. " ],
 [ " <span class='ansEng'>Well, the accent.</span><br>  What do you mean by the accent? .. " ],
 [ " <span class='ansEng'>Well .. where the sound is stressed, with which vowel it's stressed.</span><br> Where's it stressed in English? .. " ],
 [ " <span class='ansEng'>On the o.</span><br> Good. At the beginning, right? NORmal, NORmal, and in Spanish we're stressing the end, right? NorMAL. .. " ],
 [ " <span class='ans'>NorMAL</span><br> So if we assume the same happens with other words, how do you think you would say 'metal' .. " ],
 [ " <span class='ans'>Metal</span><br> Metal. <br> To get a perfect accent in Spanish we just need to pronounce all of the vowels exactly as they are written so a, e, i, o, u in Spanish is /ah/, /eh/, /ee/, /oh/, /oo/, where in English the vowel, it can have many different sounds. <br>Like if you look at the 'a' sound in apple or in mare, it's a very different sound. <br>But 'a' in Spanish is always going to be /ah/, 'e' is always going to be /eh/. <br>So if you pronounce the vowels as they're written, not this kind of uh-uh-uh English vowels that we get, then we get a perfect Spanish accent. .. " ],
 [ " <span class='ans'>NorMAL, MeTAL</span><br> Perfect. So we can begin to make sentences with this already. The word for is in Spanish is es, e-s. .. " ],
 [ " <span class='ans'>Es.</span><br> Es.<br> And this also means it is, she is, he is, or even you are, talking to somebody formally.<br> So now we can say he is normal, 'she is normal' .. " ],
 [ " <span class='ans'>Es normal</span><br> Yeah, Es normal. <br>And you pronounced an s which is excellent. <br>English speakers should beware that maybe they feel themselves pronouncing a z, because many times we have an s in English like in the word 'is' , and we pronounce a z. <br> So you might find slipping out a /z/, but this is incorrect -- you should be careful to pronounce an 's' .  <br>Es normal. Good, how would you say 'legal' .. " ],
 [ " <span class='ans'>Legal</span><br> Yeah, legal. <br>So how would you say 'it is legal' .. " ],
 [ " <span class='ans'>Es legal</span><br> Es legal. 'illegal' .. " ],
 [ " <span class='ans'>Ilegal</span><br> Ilegal, good. <br>So here in English we have an i and an e producing the same sound, 'illegal'. <br> The i and the e are producing the same sound, so this is really confusing if you want to learn English. But in Spanish you're not going to have this problem. The 'i' is like in ink and the 'e' is like in elephant. Ilegal. <br>So, it is 'illegal' .. " ],
 [ " <span class='ans'>Es ilegal</span><br> Good. Es ilegal. <br>What if you wanted to say 'he is liberal' ? <br>You don't need the word for he if you know who you're talking about, you can just use es. .. " ],
 [ " <span class='ans'>Es liberal</span><br> Yeah, es liberal. <br>Now Spanish is much more phonetic than English; what that means is that the letters are going to represent the same sound, where English has a million rules and a million exceptions to those rules. <br>I mean it's really hard even for native English speakers often to understand how to pronounce a new word when they see it written; but you're not going to have that problem in Spanish. <br>So you know natural and you don't just want to just change the accent and say natuRAL; this is not Spanish. <br>You want to think 'how is it written?' and pronounce the letters as they are. <br>So how do you think you would say 'natural' in Spanish? .. " ],
 [ " <span class='ans'>Natural</span><br> Natural, good. <br>That's a t, so you pronounce a t. A is like /ah/, u is like /oo/: natural. Very good, and the accent on the end as well. <br>'it's natural' .. " ],
 [ " <span class='ans'>Es natural</span><br> Es Natural. <br>If you want to say it isn't or it's not, the word for not or don't is the same as the word for no. <br>And the word for no in Spanish is the same as the word for no in English, but you pronounce it like in Spanish. <br>So how do you think you say 'no' in Spanish? .. " ],
 [ " <span class='ans'>No</span><br> No. <br>Good. <br>And you put this before is if you want to say it is not, he is not, she is not, you (formal) are not. <br>So how would that sound, 'it is not' .. " ],
 [ " <span class='ans'>No es</span><br> No es, good. <br>So now we can say things like 'it's not normal' .. " ],
 [ " <span class='ans'>No es normal</span><br> No es normal.<br> How would you say 'ideal' ? <br>So really think about how it's spelled and try and pronounce each of those vowels as they're written. <br>'i' like ink, 'e' like elephant, 'a' like apple .. " ],
 [ " <span class='ans'>Ideal</span><br> Good. Ideal. <br>How would you say 'it's ideal' .. " ],
 [ " <span class='ans'>Es ideal</span><br> Es ideal. <br>'it's not ideal' .. " ],
 [ " <span class='ans'>No es ideal</span><br> Good. <br>No es ideal. Perfect. <br>How would you say 'fatal' .. " ],
 [ " <span class='ans'>Fatal</span><br> Fatal. Good. <br>'natal' .. " ],
 [ " <span class='ans'>Natal</span><br> Natal, good. <br>'colonial' .. " ],
 [ " <span class='ans'>Colonial</span><br> Colonial. <br>'cultural' .. " ],
 [ " <span class='ansEng'>Cultural?</span><br> So think about how it's written. .. " ],
 [ " <span class='ans'>Cultural</span><br> Yes and perfect Spanish accent there. Cultural, very nice. <br>'annual' .. " ],
 [ " <span class='ans'>Anual</span><br> Anual. <br>And you cut this y sound that comes in English ann-y-ual. <br>This y sound comes from nowhere in English and you cut it out because you focused on how it's written. <br>Anual. Very nice.<br>'dental' .. " ],
 [ " <span class='ans'>Dental</span><br> Tooth in Spanish is diente. So this is coming from dental. <br>So if you look up tooth in the dictionary and you find diente, rather than treating it as a random piece of vocabulary that you have to memorize, you can relate it back to dental. <br>Oh okay, like dental it comes from there. <br>And this is useful for memory. <br>A couple more 'festival' .. " ],
 [ " <span class='ans'>Festival</span><br> 'personal' .. " ],
 [ " <span class='ans'>Personal</span><br> Personal. Good, 'total' .. " ],
 [ " <span class='ans'>Total</span><br> Total. Good, 'verbal' .. " ],
 [ " <span class='ans'>Verbal</span><br> Verbal. <br>So if we wanted to say verb, we might not have a rule to convert that word over. <br>But if we know verbal is verbal, we can guess that the verb is probably going to be the same in Spanish. <br>And most of the time words are either the same that we don't have a rule, maybe we need to stick an o or an e or an a on the end. <br>So we can make a guess. How do you think you say 'verb' in Spanish? .. " ],
 [ " <span class='ans'>Verbo</span><br> Yeah, that's right. <br>So with structure, with the building, when we're going to be making sentences with these words, we don't ever want to guess. <br>We want to take our time and think it through. <br>But with vocabulary, we can happily guess and try. <br>Imagine we said verba for example, and they would look at us funny and they would go 'ah verbo' and when that person says 'ah, verbo' then we learn 'oh ok this is the right word'. <br>And it's the best way to learn quickly. <br> -- end of track -- <br> " ]
] ,
[
 [ "Track 3<br>So what was 'he is', 'she is', 'it is' .. " ],
 [ " <span class='ans'>Es</span> <br>Es. <br>Good, we can use this with some other convertible words as well to make sentences. <br>Another rule for these convertible words is that words in English that end -ant or -ent, most of them we can just stick an e on the end and they become Spanish . <br>So for example, important becomes importante. <br>Importante. Where is the stress there? .. " ],
 [ " <span class='ansEng'>In the second to last.</span> <br> Good. <br>The stress is as much part of the word as the sounds, which is why we want to get into the habit of just processing where is the accent, not trying to memorize it, just looking where it is. <br>Not trying to memorize it, just observing it. <br>How would you say 'it is important' .. " ],
 [ " <span class='ans'>Es importante</span> <br> Es importante. 'It's not important' .. " ],
 [ " <span class='ans'>No es importante</span> <br>No es importante. How would you say 'different' .. " ],
 [ " <span class='ans'>Diferente</span> <br>Diferente. 'It's not different' .. " ],
 [ " <span class='ans'>No es diferente</span> <br>Good, no es diferente. <br>How would you say 'constant' .. " ],
 [ " <span class='ans'>Constante</span> <br>Yeah, constante. <br>How would you say 'it is constant' .. " ],
 [ " <span class='ans'>Es constante</span> <br> Es constante. <br>If you add on -mente, -mente, you get the sound 'ly' in English. <br>If you want to say constantly you can say constantemente, and it's one word, constantemente. .. " ],
 [ " <span class='ans'>Constantemente</span> <br>Good, so how would you say 'legally' .. " ],
 [ " <span class='ans'>Legalmente</span> <br>Perfect, legalmente. <br> 'illegally' .. " ],
 [ " <span class='ans'>Ilegalmente</span> <br>Ilegalmente. <br>How do you think you say 'real' in Spanish? .. " ],
 [ " <span class='ans'>Real</span> <br>Real. <br>Good, when we have an r at the beginning you might hear it like a rolling r. Real. How do you think you would say 'really' .. " ],
 [ " <span class='ans'>Realmente</span> <br>Realmente. <br>Real also means royal. Like Real Madrid is not, you know, real Madrid, it's Royal Madrid. <br>How would you say 'normally' .. " ],
 [ " <span class='ans'>Normalmente</span> <br>Good, normalmente. So what would it mean if I said to you 'normalmente es importante' ? <br>  what does that mean? .. " ],
 [ " <span class='ansEng'>Normally, as in usually, it's important.</span> <br>Very good, this is true.<br> You actually use normally like usually. Normalmente es importante. <br>Now if we have a /j/ sound in a convertible word so we're not working with the letter g, we're working with the sound here, we're thinking about the sound. <br>If we have a /j/ sound in a convertible word, this /j/ is going to become /kh/ in Spanish. <br>Now if you know how to say Argentina for example in Spanish, if you've heard that anywhere, this is a good hook to remember this rule. If we have a /j/ sound it's going to become /kh/ as a sound. This doesn't mean a g. <br>For example how would you say 'global' .. " ],
 [ " <span class='ans'>Global</span> <br>Global. 'globally' .. " ],
 [ " <span class='ans'>Globalmente</span> <br>Globalmente. <br>So it's not a g, it's the /j/ sound. <br>'general' is going to become? .. " ],
 [ " <span class='ans'>General</span> <br>Very good, general. So we're causing a bit of friction in the throat, general. <br>'generally' .. " ],
 [ " <span class='ans'>Generalmente</span> <br>Generalmente. Good. <br>'original' .. " ],
 [ " <span class='ans'>Original</span> <br>Original. <br>'originally' .. " ],
 [ " <span class='ans'>Originalmente</span> <br> Good, originalmente.<br> 'digital' .. " ],
 [ " <span class='ans'>Digital</span> <br> Digital. Good, 'naturally' .. " ],
 [ " <span class='ans'>Naturalmente</span> <br> Good. How would you say 'naturally it's original' .. " ],
 [ " <span class='ans'>Naturalmente es original</span> <br>Good. <br>So naturalmente, you can also use it a little bit like obviously, something like that. <br>Words ending -ible or -able, we can also convert many of them . <br>We just have to pronounce them syllable by syllable and put the accent second from the end. <br>So possible becomes posible .. " ],
 [ " <span class='ans'>Posible</span> <br>'probable' .. " ],
 [ " <span class='ans'>Probable</span> <br>Yeah, probable. <br>How would you say 'probably' .. " ],

 [ " <span class='ans'>Posiblemente</span> <br>Good. <br>'Possibly it's original' .. " ],

 [ " <span class='ans'>Flexible</span> <br>" ] ,
 [ "Flexible. <br>Good. <br>However, you can't do this with the word do-able, for example. It's when the -able or -ible is really part of the word, you will probably be able to do this.<br> Some of these rules are more useful than others, some of these rules have more exceptions than others. <br>We want to just get in the habit of identifying them and then getting this sense of what words in English are from Latin, and which ones we can experiment with converting over to Spanish. <br>Now, this gives us over 3,000 words, and there are enough words to be very conversational. <br>So we want to feel free to experiment with the vocabulary, but at the same time we don't want to feel restricted by the fact that we might find an exception or we might use one that doesn't work. <br>And feeling comfortable about that possibility of making that error is what really allows you to learn quickly.<br> Because with this experimentation, you find very quickly the words that you can use. <br>-- end of track --<br><br>" ]

 [ " <span class='ans'>Urgente</span> <br>Good, Urgente. Urgente. How would you say 'urgently' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Urgentemente</span> <br>Urgentemente. <br> I love you in Spanish is 'te quiero', literally 'I want you'. <br> You might have also heard 'te amo'. You should be wary of this difference. <br> 'Te quiero' you can use with friends, you can use with lovers very soon.<br> 'Te amo' is much much more serious, but 'te quiero' is very common and it literally means 'I want you'. <br> So 'te' is you, we can get rid of this and here we are left with 'I want' ..

 [ " <span class='ans'>Quiero</span> <br>Quiero. Good, how would you say 'I don't want' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>No quiero</span> <br>No quiero. <br> Good, we just put no before. <br> One of my favourite rules for convertible words is the rule for words ending -ion. <br> This is an extremely useful rule. <br>Words ending -ion are the same in English and Spanish, just in Spanish they have the accent on the end. <br> So for example, in English we have opinion, and in Spanish you are going to pronounce syllable by syllable, making sure that you are pronouncing the vowels as they are written and you are going to put the accent on the end. .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Opinión</span> <br>Opinión. Good, 'passion' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Pasión</span> <br>Pasión. Good! <br>And you pronounced an s because we don't want /sh/. <br> 'Preparation' ? Now if it's -tion, t-i-o-n, if we have -tion, it's going to be c-i-o-n in Spanish. <br> And this c-i-o-n is pronounced /ción/ like an s in most of the Spanish-speaking world, or in most of Spain it's pronounced /thion/. <br> So you can choose, if you have a particular affiliation for Spain you can make this /th/. <br> If not, I suggest using the /s/ sound because the majority of Spanish speakers are using this sound and it's also much easier. <br> It doesn't appear difficult here: preparación, but if you want to ask for a beer for example with the /s/ sound you are going to ask for a /cervesa/, if you are going to ask using the /th/ sound you are going to ask for a /cervetha/. <br> So, I would suggest unless you have a particular affiliation with Spain or you particularly want to be practicing with some Spanish friends or whatever to use the /s/ sound. <br> So you have a word like organization, that z as well is going to sound like an s or a /th/. <br> /Or-ga-ni-tha-thión/, so you see, much easier, then this is /or-ga-ni-sa-ción/. ..

 [ " <span class='ans'>Genaración</span> <br>Generación. .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Generación</span> <br>Good. We had a little bit slipping in from English, one of the vowels there, but if you take it syllable by syllable we get every vowel perfect. Generación .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Generación</span> <br>'confirmation' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Confirmación</span> <br>Confirmación. .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'>I was tempted to say confermación.</span> <br>Ah! But you thought 'no, 'i' like ink.' <br> This is actually called 'language transfer', so this is negative language transfer. <br> Things that come from English affecting your Spanish which are not part of Spanish, are negative language transfer.<br>  And what is useful from English like these convertible words that we are using, as far as language learning is concerned, this is positive language transfer. <br> So part of our journey here is to identify what is negative language transfer and what is positive language transfer and using both to our advantage. <br> And English becomes more interesting when we learn Spanish because we start to see where some words come from, where is the inherent wisdom in the vocabulary. <br> So confirmation for example means with signing. <br> Con is with in Spanish and firma is signature. <br> So when you confirm you are doing it 'with signature'. <br>'conversation' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Conversación</span> <br>Good. And this means 'with verses', 'with verse'. <br>'confrontation' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Confrontación</span> <br>Confrontación. And front actually, like in frontación, comes from frente which means forehead. So it's 'with the forehead', when you confront you go forward with the forehead. <br>'complication' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Complicación</span> <br>Complicación. <br> Here com- is also con- but it changes to an m because of that p. <br> It happens the same in English and Spanish.<br>  Complicación. But this is 'with folding' from Latin, plicare, to fold. <br> You know when you fold stuff up I guess it gets more complicated or something like that. <br> The reason why this is my favourite rule is because out of these words ending -ion, if you take the words that end –ation, if you take those words and you get rid of the –tion and you put an r on the end you get the verb. <br> Let me give you an example. <br> Preparation, preparación, preparar. <br> And there you get the verb to prepare. <br> So there is like 1,000 verbs now we know in Spanish. <br> What was 'generation' ..

 [ " <span class='ans'>Quiero prepararme</span> <br>Good, quiero prepararme. <br> I want to prepare me. <br> I want to prepare myself and this means I want to get ready and you can use this like I want to get ready. <br> Quiero prepararme. <br> Now this probably sounds quite formal in English: I want to prepare myself, but we should be aware that in English, Latin words sound especially formal. <br> Not always: cancel doesn't sound formal because it's the only word we use to say cancel. <br> But most of the time we have two words with similar meanings, like for example you might have to find and then to encounter, which sounds a little bit more formal or a little bit more literary or flowery. <br> And these ones that have these different feelings in English are generally Latin words. <br> And the Germanic words like find, which in German is Finden (same word), sound more everyday, colloquial. <br> Now we should bear in mind that that's in English, and Latin words in Spanish, which is more Latin, of course don't sound formal, they just sound normal.<br> -- end of track -- <br> " ]

 [ "Track 5 <br> You might have noticed we are not using the word for I. 'Quiero' by itself means I want. There is a word for I, the word for I is 'yo' . Y-o. .. " ] ,

 [ " <span class='ansEng'>I want to illustrate.</span> <br>Yes! I want to illustrate. <br>This is an interesting word as well, actually. The lus inside of ilustrar means light, and the word luz, l-u-z, (so actually this z would be pronounced /th/ in most of Spain - /looth/ - but in the rest of Spanish-speaking world /loos/) means light so you can use that word as well. <br>How would you say I want to find out? Now in Spanish you will say something like I want to inform myself. 'I want to inform myself' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Quiero informarme</span> <br>Good, very good. Quiero informarme. So how was 'information' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Información</span> <br>Información, very good. What was 'you' , in the sense of I love you, 'I want you' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Te</span> <br>And this is informal you, this is used informally. How would you say then 'I don't want to oblige you' ? You might think 'I don't know this!' It's very important, sentences that we think we don't know, to take them block by block. And in this way we will realise we can say so much in Spanish that we would have assumed that we don't know how to say. So the first bit is 'I don't want' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>No quiero</span> <br>No quiero. To oblige? So we look to see if we have 'obligation' in English: we have it, it's a word. <br>It's legal, so how is that? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Obligación</span> <br>Obligación. And 'to oblige' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Obligar</span> <br>Obligar. So we don't want to jump from oblige to sticking -ar on it. We want to take that long route. Obligation, obligación, obligar. And then we find the word in Spanish. So, I don't want, no quiero, to oblige you .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>No quiero obligarte</span> <br>Good, no quiero obligarte. I don't want to oblige you. I don't want to make you do it. So in English we would say make you, maybe. Maybe oblige sounds a little bit too formal, but in Spanish it's everyday language. How would you say 'I don't want to provoke you' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>No quiero provocarte</span> <br>Good, no quiero provocarte. The word for it in Spanish is 'lo' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Lo</span> <br>Lo. So how would you say 'I want to cancel it' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Quiero cancelarlo</span> <br>Good, quiero cancelarlo. How would you say 'I want to regulate it' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Quiero regularlo</span> <br>Good. I want to talk about this r. An initial r, like in regular in most Spanish dialects, it's a rolling r. You get this flick of the tongue, regular. Real, we saw this as well in real, real. Now, if you can't make that sound, I don't want you to worry about it yet, it's something that I couldn't pronounce it actually, I couldn't pronounce it for a long time, and it was really frustrating, and I was trying to pronounce it, and when you are trying to pronounce it your mouth gets tense and actually you need a very relaxed mouth to pronounce this r because you are kind of lifting your tongue up a little bit and letting the air flap it. <br>Now that's a muscle. If it's tense the air can't flap it. So I tried a very long time, I got very frustrated and I gave up and then I was practising Spanish in Peru, one day I started speaking about rice, which is arroz and the r came out all by itself and I was so excited that I was jumping up and down saying arroz arroz arroz and then I heard 'the gringo is hungry'. <br>My advice if you can't pronounce this sound is just to let it come. The more you hear, just because you want to pronounce it it's going to come. <br>So initial r or two r's together inside the word is going to pronounce this double r. <br>So, the word for but in Spanish is 'pero' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Pero</span> <br>P-e-r-o. And the word for dog is 'perro' . P-e-r-r-o. .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Perro</span> <br>So that's the difference. You have normal r: pero. .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Pero</span> <br>And it's a bit different to English because it's still kind of more pronounced. You know you are still using your tongue more there. Pero. And then perro, you keep that in the same position that you are using to make that Spanish r which is kind of a little bit more pronounced than the /r-r-r/ English sound, but you pass a little bit of air over it and you let that flick it. Perro. .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Perro</span> <br>Now, like I said, I don't want you to worry about if you can't pronounce this, there are even native Spanish speakers that can't pronounce this, so it's really something I don't want to inhibit anybody. How do you think is 'salvation' in Spanish? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Salvación</span> <br>Salvación. So how do you think would be 'to save' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Salvar</span> <br>Salvar. This word that we used for it, lo, can also mean him. So how would you say 'I want to save him' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Quiero salvarlo</span> <br>Good, quiero salvarlo. I want to save him. How would you say 'situation' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Situación</span> <br>Situación. Good, now if you turn that into a verb you actually get 'to situate', to place, to put somewhere. So how would that be? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Situar</span> <br>Situar. Good, 'participation' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Participación</span> <br>Participación. 'to participate' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'>Partipi ..</span> <br>So, take it syllable by syllable. This is very important, so it doesn't become like a salad. You want to take it syllable by syllable. .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'>Participation - participación - partipisar</span> <br>Slower. .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Participar</span> <br>Participar. <br>So we must take it slowly, sometimes you don't need to take it slowly, but we want to get in the habit of taking it slowly, dividing up syllable by syllable. <br>We want to install the correct process slowly. <br>We don't want to jump from participate to participar because maybe we end up putting some extra sound 'participatar' or something like this and we don't want to do this. <br>We want to take the long route. <br>So for example, if you want to work out how to say to create in Spanish you want to go through the long way, you want to go through 'creation' . .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Creación</span> <br>And then? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Crear</span> <br>Yeah. <br>And that's it, that's the verb in Spanish. Crear, to create. <br>How is 'to experiment' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'>So it's experimentation. Experimentación - </span><span class='ans'>experimentar</span> <br>Yeah, that's it. Experimentar. <br>And this also means to experience. <br>To experiment and to experience, which is a little bit of wisdom that I really like there from Spanish because your experience is like an experiment. If you think that your relationship with experience is scientific, you look what happens and you learn from it, or at least you should. <br>So in Spanish, there is a suggestion of that in the fact that these words are the same, to experience and to experiment is the same verb, experimentar. <br>The nouns are different. Experience is experiencia, experiment is experimento. <br>But the verb, the act, is the same verb, experimentar. <br>Actually this gives us another nice rule: experience, experiencia. <br>If we have a word that ends in –ence or –ance, we can change –ence to –encia and –ance to –ancia, and we will get the word in Spanish<br> 'Difference' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Diferencia</span> <br>Good. 'Influence' .. " ] ,

 [ "Track 6 <br> What do you think intento might mean? Quiero is I want, and this -o is showing that it's I. If you heard intento, what do you think it might mean? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'>Try?</span> <br>Yeah. How did you know that? Do you know how you knew that? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'>Yeah. I sort of went from intend, I intend to do something.</span> <br>There is no rule here to convert intention to a verb. It's not –ation so we can't take off the –ation and put –r .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'>Yeah.</span> <br>But we have intention, we know what is the meaning so we can hear a verb like this and understand what it means. Intento means I try or I am trying. I try or I am trying. So how would you say I am trying to publish it? Again it's something you think 'I can't say this in Spanish!'.. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Intento publicarlo</span> <br>Good. Intento publicarlo. I try to publish it or I am trying to publish it. We've got both there. <br>Good. How would you say 'I am trying to administrate it' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Intento administrarlo</span> <br>Good. Intento administrarlo. 'I am trying to imitate it' or 'I am trying to imitate him'. It could mean either .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'>Intento, OK, it's imitation-imitación-imitar .. </span><span class='ans'>Intento imitarlo</span> <br>Exactly. Now h's in Spanish are completely silent. You must be careful not even to think them because they will have a habit of slipping out even if you think it. So it's written, the h is written in convertible words for example, like hospital (ends in –al) but it's not pronounced. You must imagine that it begins with an o. So how would you say 'hospital' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'>Hospital</span> <br>See? You thought of the h and a little kind of aspiration came there, which is fine, but to get the perfect accent you really want to think in your mind that it begins with o .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Hospital</span> <br>There you are, perfect. Hospital. Horrible .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Horrible</span> <br>Good. And here we have an example of double r inside the word. Horrible, horrible. If you can't pronounce that you just make horrible and it will be perfectly understood: there is no problem there. Good. How would you say 'habitual' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Habitual</span> <br>Habitual. 'Habitually' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Habitualmente</span> <br>Habitualmente. The word for now in Spanish is 'ahora' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Ahora</span> <br>This is spelled a-h-o-r-a. A-h-o-r-a. Ahora .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Ahora</span> <br>Good. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'>Is the h silent in every ..</span> <br>Yeah. Unless it's c-h in which case it's like English /ch/. Ahora is actually the combination of two words: a which means to and hora which means hour. So it's something like 'to the hour'. So that gives us another couple of words as well, 'a' meaning to in the sense of direction, to somewhere, and 'hora' meaning hour. Ahora, now. So how would you say 'I want to cancel it, but I don't want to cancel it now' ? We said that the word for but is pero. So we want to divide it up piece by piece. I want .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Quiero</span> <br>To cancel it .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Cancelarlo</span> <br>Good. But .. " ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Cancelarlo</span> <br>Now .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Ahora</span> <br>Perfect! So a big sentence which we might imagine that we can't take on; if we divide it up bit by bit we realise that we can think our way through it. The word for I go or I am going in Spanish is voy. Voy.</span> <br>Voy .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Voy</span> <br>Good. Now this is actually spelled v-o-y. Now the v in Spanish can sound like a v in English like a /v/ or it can sound like a soft b like /boy/. You might be familiar with the word vamos which means let's go, literally we are going, used a lot like let's go, vamos. Now this is spelled v-a-m-o-s. What you probably hear there is a b. It really depends where you are: in the southern cone around Argentina and Chile you hear a lot more /v/ kind of pronunciation in many places. Generally in the Spanish-speaking world it's like a soft b so we want to make that association now between v and soft b. To remember this word, voy, we can think of a voyage so we can see the connection there between voyage and to go. I go or 'I am going' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Voy</span> <br>I am going now .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Voy ahora</span> <br>Voy ahora. I am not going now .. " ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Visitar </span><span class='ansEng'>?</span> <br>Yeah. Why did you think that? Was it just a guess? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'>Well, it's visitation ..</span> <br>Visitation, does that exist? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'>I think so, visitation rights?</span> <br>Exactly! Very good! This is it. It's a word that exists that we only use in some context, like visitation rights. Visitar, visitar, if you are not comfortable with the soft b just pronounce a v, it doesn't matter. When you practice Spanish you are going to pick up the accent of who you are speaking to so it's not a fundamental issue of ours right now. So, visitar. I want to visit him .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Quiero visitarlo</span> <br>Good. We can look at some other words now with this v sound and experiment a little bit with the sound. So how do you think you would say 'visible' in Spanish? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Visible</span> <br>Good. <br>There is something very good that you are doing here, you are not pronouncing that s as a z like in English: visible. <br>Many people at home will find themselves doing this, putting that z there from English and pronouncing vi-zi-ble. <br>We don't want that, we want visible. <br>And the v is like a soft b. If you want more elaboration of what is this soft b you can put a small piece of paper in front of your mouth and make the b in English like bucket and you will see that paper move with that burst of air that comes with bucket. <br>That hard b in English is a plosive sound, it means you gather up a little bit of air and you shoot it out when you make that b, where this b doesn't have that, it's a soft one. So you can experiment with that, again like I say we don't want to stress out about sounds, to use a v sound is perfectly fine. <br>Viral .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Viral</span> <br>Viral. Good. So if viral is viral how do you think 'virus' might be? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Viro</span> <br>Virus. It's actually the same word, you are just pronouncing it exactly as it is. Virus.<br>Convenient .. " ] ,

 [ " Track 7<br>How would you say 'I want to carry on' ? Now you think 'carry on, I don't know this!' So, one of the skills we want to really make use of these convertible words is to find the Latin equivalent of carry on. I want to carry on, I want to go on, I want to .. ? What is the Latin word that we could use here? Nothing comes to mind? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'>Like?</span> <br>So, think of-.. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'>Ah, continue.</span> <br>So you can think of a -tion word that has something to do with carrying on? .. " ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Quiero continuar</span> <br>Quiero continuar. I want to continue it .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Quiero continuarlo</span> <br>Good. I am trying to continue .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'>I've already forgotten what trying is.</span> <br>So it's not about remembering, it's about knowing how to find it. So there are a few things you could think about, that when we discuss this word, that could lead you back to it, and the important thing is to take that time to have those thoughts rather than just, 'Oh, do I know it? Do I not?'.. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Intención</span> <br>Intención. There wasn't a rule here because it doesn't finish -ation. Our rule was for ones that finish -ation, but it was very similar. Do you remember what it is now? I try, so it ends in -o like-.. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Ah, intento</span> <br>Intento, good, so that's I try. We want to see first if we can find it .. relaxed, not .. you know if your brain locks on 'Do I remember it or don't I?' Game over. But if you go 'Okay, what was that related to, what was that about?' And just see what pops up, then you are much more likely to get it. <br>So, Intento. Intento is I try.

 [ " <span class='ans'>Mostrar</span> <br>Mostrar, and that means to show. To show. Mostrar. So we might think again, mostrar has no connection that we can hook on to, but usually when we have a look we can find some connection through English, Latin English, that helps us interiorize. Mostrar, to show. The word for something is algo. Algo. A-l-g-o. Algo .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Algo</span> <br>Algo, good. What was the word for you, like in I love you, how was 'I love you' .. " ] ,

 [ " <span class='ansEng'>Voy</span> <br>The beginning bit of voyage, and you're mostly going to hear it pronounced more like a soft b. Voy. Voy .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Voy</span> <br>Now, just as in English, we say I am going to .. and we talk about the future. I am going to continue. I am going to eat later. We can do exactly the same thing in Spanish. The only difference is that even though, for example, if we use continue – continuar - continuar means to continue. In Spanish we say voy a continuar. It's actually because voy is a verb of movement, and when we are putting a 'to' form, a verb that is 'to' something like continuar after a verb of movement, a verb that has some kind of motion in its meaning like voy: I am going, Spanish wants to show this feeling of motion so you say I am going to and you put the to for that movement, even if you're not actually moving and you're just using it to speak about the future. So, if you want to say, for example, 'I am going to confiscate it' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Voy a confiscarlo</span> <br>Good. Voy a confiscarlo. Very good. How do you say I am going to examine it? I am going to examine it .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Voy a examinarlo</span> <br>Good. Voy a examinarlo. Good. Now we said lo is it or him. Now the plural of him is them. This is not very obvious in English because him and them, they look very different as words. We don't ever think of them as the plural of him or of her but it is. It's very obvious in Spanish, lo means him or it and if you want to get them, if you want to make it plural, what do you think you might do? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'>Just add the s? </span><span class='ans'>Los.</span> <br>Los. Good. So now we have the word for them. To see is ver, ver. We have view in English, like view, ver. So how would you say, 'I want to see them' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'>Quiero a verlos?</span> <br>Why 'a' here? .. " ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Quiero verlos</span> <br>And if you say 'I am trying to see them' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Intento verlos</span> <br>Good. No a. Intento verlos. Because ver is to see. To try, so trying in its 'to' form, to try is intentar. Intentar. This is to try. So how would you say 'I want to try' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Quiero intentar</span> <br>Good. I am going to try .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Voy a intentar</span> <br>Good. With a. Voy a intentar. 'I am going to try to see them' .. " ] ,

Let me give you another example of a verb that connects with this 'a', so voy isn't isolated, we can understand the concept better if we see another verb of movement. So another verb of movement is pasar. What do you think pasar means? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'>Is it to pass?</span> <br>Yes, pasar is to pass and to pass by, so I'm going to pass by to visit you. I'm going to pass by to visit you. How would we say this? The first bit is I am going .. " ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>A pasar</span> <br>Good. To visit you .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Visitarlo, visitarte</span> <br>Well actually lo, other than him and it, can also mean formal you, so if you're speaking formally, you can use this lo as well. But I want to go back to pasar. Pasar is a verb of movement. Let's take the sentence again from the beginning. The whole sentence is I'm going to pass by to visit you .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Voy a. So it's voy a pasar a visitarlo.</span> <br>Good, lo if you are speaking formally or te if you are speaking informally. Voy a pasar a visitarte. Voy a pasar a visitarlo.

 [ " <span class='ans'>Formal</span> <br>And 'formally' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Formalmente</span> <br>Very good. Now, if you want to say, 'I am going to try to pass by to visit you', we have to think which ones we are going to use this 'a' with and which ones not, which is a great exercise for us to internalise this rule. So, 'I am going to try' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Voy a intentar</span> <br>To pass by .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>A, no. Voy a intentar pasar.</span> <br>To visit you .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>A visitarte</span> <br>Very good. So we learned that rule. Voy a intentar pasar a visitarte. There's not many times that we have something between the verbs so there's not going to be a lot of rules like this, don't worry, but this one's important because there are many important verbs of motion that we will be putting this a after. How was 'to demonstrate' again? .. " ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Mostrarte algo</span> <br>Good. Quiero pasar a, because we had the verb of movement, mostrarte algo. So if we are connecting a verb of movement to another verb we connect using this extra 'a', to. Quiero pasar a mostrarte algo. <br>Good.<br>-- end of track -- <br>" ]

 [ "Track 8 <br >What was again the word then for it or for him or for you (formal)? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Lo</span> <br>Lo. If we make this feminine, so we change the o to an a, and we're going to see other examples of this way of making something feminine in Spanish, we get la. And this means her, it (a feminine thing), so objects as well. <br>Well, not objects. Objects don't have gender. When people speak about languages that have gender, they tend to think that the object has the gender. <br>But it's not the object, it's the word. <br> You might have two words for the same object, and one might be masculine and one might be feminine. So it's the word. <br>A feminine word for example usually are ones that end in a. So like casa, casa, house. If you want to say 'I want to see it', and with this it you mean the house. <br>What do you think you will say? 'I want to see it' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Quiero verla</span> <br>Good. Quiero verla. Now what else could that sentence mean, other than I want to see it (the feminine thing)? what else could it mean? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'>Oh. It could also mean I want to see her.</span> <br>Yes, exactly. So we get quite a few meanings just with this little lo and adding an s to it or changing the o to an a. We actually get a lot of options. La could mean her, and it also could mean you (formal) talking to a female. So you could be saying I want to see you, formally. Now, where you use the formal language and the informal language really, really depends on the dialect. <br>So the safe way is to go in with the formal and to see what happens and to see how people address you and see how people address each other in this context, and you can adjust accordingly. For example, in Spain, when you meet somebody, when you're going to a shop, when you meet somebody for the first time - with the exception of kind of young peers - the common thing is to begin speaking formally. <br>If I compare this to Buenos Aires, for example, in Argentina, it's almost never used, this formal way of addressing people. In fact, it's used more often to insult somebody with an extra layer of sarcasm or irony, than say, than it's actually used sincerely to be formal. So it really depends on the place. You want to go and see. But to play safe, you can use the formal, which will be lo or la, speaking to a male or to a female. Lo and la instead of te. <br>Quiere means he wants, she wants, it wants or you (formal) want. We can see that these four, they band together. Not just in words like lo and la, but in the verbs as well. We saw it with es, that es means it is, she is, he is, you (formal) are. So they will band together. Quiere means he wants, she wants, it wants, you (formal) want. So, how would you say 'you want to visit me' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Quiere visitarme</span> <br>Good. Quiere visitarme. You want to visit me. Now if you want to make that a question, in English, you put do, do you want? But in Spanish, you won't do anything like that. In Spanish, you will just make it sound like a question with your voice. So, how would you say 'do you want to visit me?' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>¿Quiere visitarme?</span> <br>Good. ¿Quiere visitarme? How would you say 'you don't want to visit me' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>No quiere visitarme</span> <br>You sounded very sad when you said that. No quiere visitarme. Now if you want to say Don't you want to visit me? Again, English gets really complicated there. But not Spanish. So, 'don't you want to visit me?' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>¿No quiere visitarme?</span> <br>Good. ¿No quiere visitarme? You could add the word for why. The word for why is por qué. Por qué .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Por qué</span> <br>It's actually the word for because as well. 'So why don't you want to visit me?' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>¿Por qué no quiere visitarme?</span> <br>Good. ¿Por qué no quiere visitarme? The verb for to come is venir .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Venir</span> <br>So of course you could hear /v/, like I just pronounced for you, so you would get the spelling venir. But more commonly you would hear /benir/, /benir/, like a soft b. Firstly, let's say, 'do you want to come?' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>¿Quiere venir?</span> <br>Good. ¿Quiere venir? And a nice way to remember venir, actually, is conveniente, convenient, 'with coming', when things come together. Or if you ever heard welcome in Spanish, you might have heard bienvenido or bienvenida, bienvenidos, bienvenidas. Literally the same as welcome. Well is bien, and come, there we have venidos, a different version of venir. So venir, to come. If you want to say the house, it's 'la casa' .. " ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Por qué</span> <br>Good. 'Why don't you want to come to visit me?' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>¿Por qué no quiere venir a visitarme?</span> <br>Very good. ¿Por qué no quiere venir a visitarme? Good. And of course, here we're using 'a' because we have venir. A verb of coming and going, like voy, voy a, 'venir a', when we're connecting to a 'to' form. The word for I owe, I owe in Spanish is debo. Debo .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Debo</span> <br>Debo. The English word debt which is spelled d-e-b-t has this b from debo. It comes from there. We don't pronounce it in English, of course. But this word is from Latin and debo is I owe. The useful thing about I owe is that you can use it like I must. So if you want to say I must continue, you say I owe to continue. I owe to continue. And that's the meaning of I must continue. So how would you say that: 'I must continue' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Debo continuar</span> <br>Good. How would you say 'I must identify it' .. " ] ,

 [ " <span class='ansEng'>Yeah</span> <br>And that comes from Latin actually. That slang is coming from Latin. Saber is to know. He's got saber. He's got savvy. Saber is spelt with a b, but in English we're saying savvy with a /v/. So we're seeing even that connection between the sounds of v and b crossing between English and Spanish. Saber, savvy. So saber is to know. So if you want to say 'I want to know' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Quiero saber</span> <br>How would you say 'I don't want to know' .. " ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Venir</span> <br>Venir. Good. I want to know if she wants to come to the house to visit me. I want to know if she wants to come to the house to visit me. So again it might be something that looks overwhelming that we can't say. But if we divide it up: I want to know .. " ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>A visitarme</span> <br>Good! You put a there. Because even though we have a la casa, there in between, you stayed with the feeling of venir and you wanted to connect it to the next verb. And you are 100% correct to do that. 'I want to know why she doesn't want to come to the house to visit me'. 'I want to know' .. " ] ,

 [ " <span class='ansEng'>Segregation-segregación-</span><span class='ans'>segregar</span> <br>There you are. All of them in the 'to' form end in the letter r.

 [ " <span class='ansEng'>To breathe</span> <br>Yes. To breathe. So we could say to respire literally and we go, oh of course, this would be how I would say breathe in Spanish. Respirar. Good.

And it's either going to be -ar, -er, or -ir. a-r, e-r, i-r. <br>In fact, and talking about 'to' forms, it's actually with this 'to' that we identify what is a verb. <br>Now it's good to talk about this because at school we learn that verbs are doing words, which is really kind of unhelpful, because to be for example is, there's nothing, you're not doing anything. <br>If you say is, he is here, what is he doing? But is is a verb. <br>Is is a verb because it comes from to be. We don't say He be here. We say He is here. <br>So the way we identify what is a verb, is that you can put to in front of it. To be, to stay, to go. These are verbs. <br>And in Spanish, these are going to end in r. Either -ar, -er, or -ir. <br>Now the way we get the 'I' version, is we take off this ending, we chop off this -ar, -er, or -ir and we put -o. <br>We have an example already. We know how is to try.

Which is going to be useful for us later when we learn the past. <br>For now, we need to think that the accent in the present tense is going on the penultimate syllable.

 [ " <span class='ans'>Obtener</span> <br>Yes! Obtener. Sustain, this one changes a little bit. Sus-, which is s-u-s, becomes s-o-s in Spanish .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Sostener</span> <br>Sostener. Sustain. Maintain. Maintain, this main becomes man- in Spanish. So how would you say 'maintain' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Mantener</span> <br>Mantener. And if you heard entretener, what would you think it means? Entretener .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Entertain</span> <br>Yes. So it changes a little bit, but you can recognize it. Entretener. And entre in Spanish means between. You might hear in Spanish entre tu y yo. Between you and I. Entre tu y yo. <br>Many languages express this idea of possession in different ways. In English and in Spanish, we have a simple verb: Have, tener, to express possession. <br>But Arabic for example, you would say 'at me' or 'with me' instead of 'I have.' So it's not a straightforward concept that all languages express in the same way, this concept of possession. In Turkish, for example, if you want to say 'I have a car' you say 'My car there is.' <br>So it's not such a straightforward concept that we are expressing in all languages in the same way, this concept of possession. <br>Something that Spanish is alluding to here is kind of the symbiotic relationship in ownership. <br>When you own something, you also belong to it. You must maintain it. You must sustain it. You must contain it. It's a symbiotic relationship. You don't just own things. You are also owned by them. <br>To have is tener. And you also get these other verbs that you can use. Obtener, contener, mantener, sostener, entretener. I have is tengo. <br>What happened here? What should it be? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'>Teno</span> <br>Yes. That's what it should be. <br>But it's irregular. It has a g popping up. But the nice thing about the irregular verbs in Spanish is that we can group them together. <br>There's always a little group of verbs that do things in the same way. <br>For example, what was 'to come' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Venir</span> <br>Venir. Very good. <br>Now venir behaves like tener when it makes the I form. <br>So if tener becomes tengo, venir might become .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Vengo</span> <br>Vengo! Good. <br>So I come is vengo. It's irregular. <br>But we've already noticed two verbs that have this same pattern of irregularity. And to think of them together helps us. <br>Now if you want to say I will come tomorrow, we don't know the word for will, but we don't need it. <br>Because tomorrow is our future context. What is the word for 'tomorrow' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Mañana</span> <br>Good. <br>So 'I'm coming tomorrow' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Vengo mañana</span> <br>Vengo mañana. <br>Very good.<br>-- end of track -- <br>" ]
] ,
[
 [ "Track 11<br> So we saw how our 'to' form of the verb: to come, to eat, to tolerate. How would 'to tolerate' be? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> Toleration-toleración-</span><span class='ans'>tolerar</span> <br> Exactly, tolerar. Good. So our 'to' form ends with an r and it's always going to be -ar, -er or -ir. And we had an example of each. And we notice that for -ar, -ir and -er verbs, unless the verb is irregular, we will take off that ending and put on an -o to get the 'I' version, to say I tolerate for example. So how would you say 'I tolerate' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Tolero</span> <br> Good. And you moved the accent back as well, which is essential for the present tense. Very good. If you said toleró, it would mean he tolerated, which as I mentioned, will be useful for us later when we learn this tense. But it's important in the present tense to have the accent on the penultimate syllable. Tolero. What was 'to eat' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Comer</span> <br> And what is 'I eat' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> Comero</span> <br> So you don't add on the o, you take off the ending – and then you put .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> Oh yes, </span><span class='ans'>como</span> <br> Como. Good. This also means how or like, by coincidence. You might have heard cómo estás? - How are you? But como is also I eat. So for all verbs, we take off the ending and we add -o and we get the 'I' version. But for the rest of the versions, for he, she, it, you (formal), for we, etc., the verbs split into two groups. Although we have three different endings, we have two groups. Now most verbs in Spanish are -ar verbs. This is the biggest group. The group of -ar verbs, the verbs that end -ar. In fact any new verb that comes into Spanish will become, will be crowned, as an -ar verb. So to give you some examples - 'tuitear' . What do you think that means? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> To Twitter</span> <br> To tweet, yes, tuitear. Facebookear, yes this exists. Googlear .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> Excellent</span> <br> So there is something in the mental lexicon, in the mental dictionary that is saying there can be no more -er/-ir verbs. These are a historic group, the door is closed. So we have two groups. So for -ar, -er, -ir, if the verb is regular we take off the ending -ar, -er, -ir, and we put -o and we get the 'I' version. Now for the others, the other versions, there's a slight difference between -ar verbs and -er/-ir verbs. Now -ar verbs have the vowel /ah/ as a principal sound, as a sound that keeps popping up. So, for example, to eliminate. How is 'to eliminate' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> Elimination-eliminación-</span><span class='ans'>eliminar</span> <br> Good. Eliminar. So if you want to say I eliminate or I delete, how would it be? Think syllable by syllable. If you think of it all together it's quite confusing here because you have quite a few vowels .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Elimino</span> <br> Good. You see when you take your time to divide actually the word piece by piece, it's much more digestible. Elimino. Good. Now for he, she, it and you (formal) - we have learned that these group together in Spanish - we just use an a on the ending. So how would that be? He deletes or eliminates, she/he/you (formal) .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Elimina</span> <br> Good. And we still have the accent on the penultimate syllable, elimina. Very good. How do you think you would say to last like 'it lasts a long time' or something like this? It's not obvious through the word last, but maybe we find something through Latin that helps us work out how to say that: 'a period of time', sometimes we call it 'duration', no? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> Yes</span> <br> So how would that be in Spanish? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Duración</span> <br> So to last might actually come from this. If it did, how would it sound? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Durar</span> <br> Yes. And this is the verb, durar. A lot is much in Spanish; it's 'mucho' . So if you want to say it lasts a long time you can just say it lasts much .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> Durar mucho</span> <br> This is to last, durar. So how would 'it lasts' be? So  .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Dura mucho</span> <br> So you might be talking about a show or movie. How would you say 'it doesn't last a long time' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> No dura mucho</span> <br> Good. No dura mucho. How do you say exaggeration? Exa/juh-juh/, 'exaggeration' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Exageración</span> <br> Exageración. To exaggerate .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Exagerar</span> <br> Yeah. So how would you say 'I exaggerate' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Exagero</span> <br> He's exaggerating, or she's exaggerating or you-.. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Exagera</span> <br> Good. Exagera. He's not exaggerating, she's not exaggerating, you (formal) are not exaggerating .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> No exagera</span> <br> Good. No exagera. Good. Did you ever hear the word mastication in English? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Masticación</span> <br> Did you ever hear it though? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> Yes</span> <br> I didn't. I mean this is a word-.. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> It's 'chewing'</span> <br> Yes. So how do you think 'to chew' would be? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Masticar</span> <br> Masticar is to chew. Now I didn't know this word actually and this will happen to many English speakers as well. You will be able to work out many English words that you didn't know before through Spanish. So this was the way round it worked for me. Because I found masticar first, and then I saw in English somewhere mastication. So it can work that way round as well which is useful. Another example is morder, which means to bite. I learned this in Spanish, and then I saw in some novel I was reading, mordent. Oh ok that means biting. You can increase your English vocabulary and what you understand in English just through the Latin that you learn in Spanish. So if masticar is to chew, how would you say 'I chew' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Mastico</span> <br> Mastico. Good. And 'he chews' or 'she chews', 'it chews', 'you (formal) chew' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Mastica</span> <br> Mastica. Good. Now this is our key sound, this /a/ sound. Now we can add on different sounds to this /a/ to get other versions. So for example, if we add on an n to this /a/, we get they and we get you (plural). So in English like you guys, you all. So how would you say 'collaboration' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Colaboración</span> <br> Colaboración. To collaborate .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Colaborar</span> <br> Good. I collaborate .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Colaboro</span> <br> Good. Colaboro. He/she/it/you (formal) .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Colabora</span> <br> Colabora. You can add on to this an n and you get they or you (plural). So how would it be? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Colaboran</span> <br> Colaboran. Good. Hablar is to speak in Spanish. Hablar. It's spelled h-a-b-l-a-r. What's happening with that h? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> It's silent</span> <br> Totally silent. Hablar. How do you say 'I speak' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Hablo</span> <br> So hablo is I speak or I am speaking. Habla is .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> He/she/it or the formal.</span> <br> Good. You formal. So what would it mean if I said 'no hablan con Pablo'? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> They're not speaking with Pablo</span> <br> Good. They're not speaking with Pablo or they don't speak with Pablo. Good. How would you say 'I want to speak' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Quiero hablar</span> <br> How would you say 'I'm going to speak' ? Think of to go on a voyage .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Ah, voy</span> <br> Good .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Yes. Voy hablar</span> <br> Now I'm not sure, because hablar starts with /a/, I'm not sure if you put the a to connect them. Did you? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> Oh, no I didn't. </span><span class='ans'>Voy a hablar.</span> <br> And when you speak quickly, it will kind of blend together. Voy a hablar. Maybe it's a fraction longer, voy a hablar, but it will stick together like this. Good. Now, if we go back to this he/she/it form, habla, and we add an s, we get the you (informal) .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Hablas</span> <br> So this is speaking to one person informally. Hablas. When we have one of these little words: te, me, lo, los, la, las, they will come before the changed verb. So the changed verb is the one that isn't ending in r anymore. They will come before this verb. So if we have quiero, I want, and we want to say 'I want it', that it must come before the verb. So how would it be? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Lo quiero</span> <br> But that little word can also go after the complete verb. If we say something like I want to see it, we end up actually having an option where we put that it. But it doesn't matter; there's no change in meaning. It's exactly the same, you just have the option. So what was 'to see', which was related to English view? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Ver</span> <br> So if you want to say 'I want to see it' or 'I want to see him' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> So it's </span><span class='ans'>quiero verlo.</span> <br> Quiero verlo .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Or lo quiero ver</span> <br> Yeah you have the option. Lo quiero ver. But if you have one changed verb all by itself, you don't have the option; it must go before. You might say it's important to speak about it. Now you don't need to say about in Spanish, we're going to say to speak it and that's understood to speak about it. So here, in that clause and that bit, to speak about it is only to speak. So how would you say it's important to speak about it or literally, 'it's important to speak it' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Es importante hablarlo</span> <br> Good. So how was I must or I owe, which is related to the English word debt? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Debo</span> <br> So, 'I must invite him' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Debo invitarlo</span> <br> Or? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Lo debo invitar</span> <br> Good. So that's the deal with these little words, where we can put them. <br>Good.<br>-- end of track --" ]
] ,
[
 [ " Track 12<br> So, we're looking at -ar verbs and how they work, and we are changing them for the different people. Let's make a recap. How would you say 'to contaminate' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Contaminar</span> <br> Good. So how would you say 'it's contaminating' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Contamina</span> <br> Good. So our key vowel for -ar verbs is /a/. That's our key vowel. We add a n to get you guys or 'they contaminate' . So how would that be? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Contaminan</span> <br> And we add an s to the he/she/it form to get the you (informal). So 'you (informal) contaminate' would be .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Contaminas</span> <br> Now for -er/-ir verbs, for -er/-ir verbs, their key sound is /e/. For this closed group of historic verbs, their key sound is /e/. So, what do you think 'vender' means? Vender. What do you think that means? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> Does it have anything to do with vent and ventilation?</span> <br> No it's not a t, it's a d .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> Oh vending. Vending machine?</span> <br> Yeah. Good. So what does it mean then, vender? What does a vending machine do? It's a selling machine. Or you might have heard street vender as well. So 'I sell' or 'I'm selling' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Vendo</span> <br> 'I'm selling it' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Lo vendo</span> <br> Good. Is there anywhere else you can put that lo? Do you have the option here? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Well, we can put it at the end if it's in its vender state.</span> <br> Exactly. So no, we can't put it anywhere else. It has to go there. Lo vendo. How would you say 'I'm selling them' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Lo vendas</span> <br> It's very important when you're making .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> Véndolo. Las. Oh. Sorry.</span> <br> It's very important when you're building the sentence that you take your time to understand who's doing what. Ah? So I sell, it's me doing the selling. So I'm selling them, the first bit you want to work out is 'I'm selling'. What's that? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Vendo</span> <br> Good. And then you want to work out them. I sell is vendo. 'I sell them' is? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Los vendo</span> <br> Los vendo. Good. So this process of dividing it into two thoughts, just doing that is going to make sure that you don't kind of get this salad. Many times, you will just switch them, and you want to say 'she has them' but you will say 'they have her' . You know, so it's very important to take your time to think about those bits separately. If you're talking about feminine things like 'I sell the houses', how would it be? So it's still them we're going to say, but we mean feminine things. 'I sell them' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Las vendo</span> <br> Very good. Las vendo. If you want to say actually I sell or I am selling the houses, the word for the, we said was la. La casa also becomes plural .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Las</span> <br> Yes. And the word casa also becomes plural .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Casas</span> <br> So 'I am selling the houses' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Vendo las casas</span> <br> Yeah. I'm selling the houses, vendo las casas, or I'm selling them and you mean the houses .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Las vendo</span> <br> Las vendo. Good. The reason why we're looking at this with objects is because many people, when they're learning Spanish, they remember to change gender for people, but they kind of put all things in with lo and los and we kind of want to get out of that habit before it starts. So we imagine the houses, we refer to them as las .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> Is there a rule for which objects are female and which are not?</span> <br> Well, remember it's not strictly the object that has the gender, but the word, the noun in itself. So feminine words end in a. Words that end in a, with a few exceptions, are feminine words. So casa is feminine: la casa. And it takes la. Then there are other feminine endings. So -ión is a feminine ending. The administration is la administración. All of these words are going to be la. 'The opinion' is? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> La opinión</span> <br> La opinión. 'The association' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> La asociación</span> <br> Good. 'The celebration' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> La celebración</span> <br> La celebración. Good. If a word ends in -ity in English, it's going to be -idad in Spanish most of the time. This -idad is a feminine ending as well. So that shows us that all of these words are feminine words. So for example you have 'diversity'. You change that -ity to -idad. -idad .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Diversidad.</span> <br> Good. Diversidad. 'The diversity' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> La diversidad</span> <br> La diversidad. Good. 'The nationality' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> La nacionalidad</span> <br> La nacionalidad. The same happens with the -tion, it becomes like an s or a /th/ in most of Spain. La na/s/ionalidad, la na/th/ionalidad, you could hear either. 'The creativity' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> La creatividad</span> <br> Very well pronounced. You thought of the vowels very well. La creatividad. 'The electricity' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> La electricidad</span> <br> La electricidad. These words are very nice as well for guessing other words. Because if you have this rule, electricity becomes electricidad, you can assume that electric is probably the same in Spanish as well, just sounding more Spanish or having a small change. Even though there's no rule for that, you can assume it. So how do you think you would say 'electric' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> ElecTRIC</span> <br> Does it sound Spanish enough yet? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> ElecTRIco</span> <br> Yeah eLECtrico .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Eléctrico</span> <br> Eléctrico. How would you say 'generosity' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Generosidad</span> <br> Very good. Generosidad. How do you think you will say 'generous' ? Have a play with it .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> Gener ..</span> <br> Have a play with it and see what sits nice .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Generoso</span> <br> Yes. Generoso. Generoso. For males. For females, what do you think it would become? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Generosa</span> <br> Generosa. Exactly. How lo becomes la, generoso becomes generosa. It also can become plural as well if we're talking about more than one person, male or mixed group, how would it sound? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Generosos</span> <br> Good. And if I was just speaking about females? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Generosas</span> <br> Very good. 'Community' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Comunidad</span> <br> 'The community' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> La comunidad</span> <br> La comunidad. Feminine word, feminine ending. How do you think you would say common? Common comes from community, by the way .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> Is it cómono? Comono.</span> <br> Común .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> Ah.</span> <br> So there's no way to know that .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> Comuno or </span><span class='ans'>Común?</span> <br> Común .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Común</span> <br> Común, with the accent on the end. So there's no way to know that. You will get-.. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> It's irregular?</span> <br> There's no rule here so there's no irregularity. So maybe you will take comuno and somebody would give you that feedback of común. And then you would realize. But if you didn't take that guess, you wouldn't get the word. We will learn a lot of vocabulary very quickly this way. How would you say 'opportunity' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Oportunidad</span> <br> Oportunidad. How do you think you would say 'opportune' ? Opportune, you know we use this word in English like timely or convenient. 'Opportune' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Oportuna</span> <br> Oportuno. Or if you are talking about a feminine thing, oportuna. 'Clarity' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Claridad</span> <br> Claridad. And clear comes from clarity. So you can look at claridad and you can probably guess how to say clear .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> Clear?</span> <br> But look at the Spanish word. Claridad .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Clarido</span> <br> And the -idad is the ending isn't it? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> Oh yes, </span><span class='ans'>claro</span> <br> Yes, claro. So this is another good skill. When you're guessing, you want to get rid of the ending. This ending -idad is what's making it a noun. La claridad. Claro. And claro is used a lot conversationally. Other than meaning 'clear' as an adjective, it can also be used like 'of course'. Claro, claro, claro. You will hear this a lot in conversation to show agreement or understanding of what you've said. Claro. 'Personality' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Personalidad</span> <br> Personalidad. So we can assume that person is probably the same in Spanish as well. When I say 'the same', I mean similar .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> So again it's guessing. It could be -</span> <br> Exactly. So what do you think it sounds like? You will develop an intuition, especially through listening. This is why listening is important as well because this is what will really develop your intuition. Because you might have heard it before and not realized it .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> I've heard of persona, so I'm guessing it's persono.</span> <br> It's persona .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Oh persona</span> <br> It's persona. It's a feminine word. So remember it's the word that's feminine or masculine, not the thing. So I am a persona, even though I am a man. The word is feminine, not me. 'Sincerity' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Sinceridad</span> <br> Sinceridad. 'Sincere' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Sencero</span> <br> Sincero .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Sincero</span> <br> Sincero. So that's another example of a feminine ending. If it ends -idad, it's a feminine ending. All of these words without exception are la. If it ends -ión, that's a feminine ending. All of these words without exceptions go with la. Back to vender. How was 'I sell' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Vendo</span> <br> I want to sell .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Quiero vender</span> <br> Quiero vender. Good. 'I want to sell it' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Quiero venderlo</span> <br> Quiero venderlo. Where else could we put that lo? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Lo quiero vender</span> <br> Good. The -er/-ir verbs use as their principal sound /e/. So whilst -ar verbs use the principle sound /a/, and we got organizar and then organiza, for - what does that mean, organiza? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> He/she or it or you (formal).</span> <br> Good. So organiza, /a/ is a principal sound. Organizan means? When we add an n what does it mean? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> They.</span> <br> They organize. Or? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> You (plural).</span> <br> You (plural). So we add the n and we get they and you guys. Organizan. We add the s and we get you (informal), organizas. So /a/ is our key sound for -ar verbs, and for -er/-ir verbs, our key sound is /e/. So to get he/she/it and you formal, we'll take off our ending and put on /e/. 'He sells', 'she sells', 'it sells', 'you (formal) sell' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Vende</span> <br> Vende. How would you say 'he sells it' or 'she sells it' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Lo vende</span> <br> Good. Lo vende. Lo vende. We said that the word for something was algo, algo. So you can say 'he's selling something', 'she's selling something', 'you're selling something' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Vende algo</span> <br> Good. Vende algo. Good. What do you think we would add on to vende to get the they form or the you (plural) form? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Venden</span> <br> So we're doing actually the same. So we have a key vowel sound, which is /e/. But then the rest, we're doing the same what we did with the -ar verbs. Venden. They sell. 'They're not selling' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> No venden</span> <br> 'They're not selling it' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> No lo venden</span> <br> 'Why aren't they selling it?'  .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> ¿Por qué no lo venden?</span> <br> Good. ¿Por qué no lo venden? Why aren't they selling it to me?, you just say why aren't they selling me it? You put the personal one, me, first. The one that refers to the person it goes first. You just say why aren't they selling me it? So they are selling. How is 'they are selling' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Venden</span> <br> Venden. 'They are selling it' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Lo venden</span> <br> Good. 'They are selling me it'. So they come together and the personal one comes first .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Me lo venden.</span> <br> Me lo venden. So whilst we have this complicated stuff happening in English, they sell it to me, no, in Spanish we're just going to identify it's it and it's me, me is the personal one so it's going to come first, me lo venden. They're selling it to me. 'They're not selling it to me', or 'they don't sell it to me' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> No me lo venden</span> <br> No me lo venden. 'Why don't they sell it to me?' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> ¿Por qué no me lo venden?</span> <br> Very good. The word for us is nos. Nos, the word for us. So how would you say they are selling us something? So something, you know algo, is not one of these little words like me, lo, nos. It's going to come afterwards. So 'they are selling us something' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Nos venden algo</span> <br> Very good. Nos venden algo. But if instead of saying they're selling us something and you just wanted to say 'they're selling us it', 'they're selling it to us', 'they're selling us it' . How would it be? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Nos lo venden</span> <br> Good. Nos lo venden. Good. So there you have an us, you have an it, you have a they. It could be like hugely complicated, no, if you just took that all as a package and tried to translate it. But thinking about the verb first and then you're thinking about the other bits you need to put, then you get the sentence that you want, confident that you have the sentence that you want. How would you say 'they're not selling it to us' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> No nos lo venden</span> <br> Good. No nos lo venden. 'Why don't they sell it to us?' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> ¿Por qué no nos lo venden?</span> <br> Good. ¿Por qué no nos lo venden? <br>Very good.<br>-- end of track --" ]

 [ " Track 13<br> To do, or to make in Spanish is hacer. And it has a silent h. It's h-a-c-e-r. So in most of Spain actually that would sound ha/th/er. But ha/s/er in most of the Spanish speaking world. What verb type is it? What is the ending? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> -er</span> <br> -er verb. So actually whenever we come across a new verb, we want to make a mental note what is the ending. Or, rather than make a mental note, just process it. Remember we always want to do anything but memorize, so just looking and going 'hacer, -er verb, ok'. Just to get in that habit. If we know it's an -er verb, we know how to work with it. So how would you say 'he's doing or making', 'she is doing or making', 'you are (formal) doing or making' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Hace</span> <br> Hace. Good. 'You're doing it' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Lo hace</span> <br> Lo hace. How would you say 'they're doing it' or 'you guys are doing it' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> Los hacen ..</span><span class='ans'> Lo hacen</span> <br> Very good. Very good. Lo hacen. 'You (informal) are doing it'. So what is the sound for informal you? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Hacen</span> <br> So for informal you we add on an s to the he/she/it version. So we get .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Haces</span> <br> 'You're doing it' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Lo haces</span> <br> Good. The word for what in Spanish is qué. How do you say 'what are you doing?' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> ¿Qué haces?</span> <br> ¿Qué haces? And this is a way of saying how are you as well. ¿Qué haces?, what are you doing?, what are you up to? Good. So we see that for -ar verbs, we have the principal sound of /a/, and then we add our n or s, n for they or you (plural), and s for informal you. And for -er/-ir verbs we have the key sound /e/, and we're adding on s for informal you, n for they, you (plural). Now these associations between s and informal you, and n and they or you guys, we're going to see all throughout the Spanish verb structure .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> So this confuses me a little bit; isn't this also a memorization? Having to remember which ending goes with what people?</span> <br> There's a difference between memorization and remembering, ah? We can remember through not actively trying to memorize. So not telling you shouldn't remember anything, you need to remember Spanish. <br>I'm telling you that you're going to remember it much easier without the active process of trying to memorize anything, which blocks whichever processes we need for remembering. I like to describe it in this way: that you borrow information when you memorize it, but when you are applying it practically in this construction of these sentences, when you're looking from many different angles at the elements that we are looking at in Spanish, then you are internalizing it. Then it's really yours, you're not borrowing it. <br>Puedo in Spanish means I can, I am able. Puedo .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Puedo</span> <br> Good. P-u-e-d-o. Puedo .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Puedo</span> <br> You're probably noticing as well that the d is quite soft when it comes in the middle of a word in Spanish, rather than a hard /d/. Puedo .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Puedo</span> <br> So puedo means I can, or I am able, and the 'to' form of the verb is an -er verb. So puedo is an -er verb. So how would you say 'he can or she can' or 'it can' or 'you (formal) can' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Puede</span> <br> And how would you say informally 'you can' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Puedes</span> <br> Good. Now in English, we don't say can you to come?, but it's what we mean. Now this is an English problem; the English is taking the to away here; it does it sometimes. You don't say I must to come, you say I must come, no? It's like I am able to come. You can think of it this way as we thought of I must come as I owe to come. So how would you say 'can you come?' , talking informally .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> Puede - sorry, informal. </span><span class='ans'>¿Puedes venir?</span> <br> ¿Puedes venir? So this is what we're going to be using to talk with friends, no, this s. We're going to be hearing it a lot. If it helps you make the association, you might have heard ¿cómo estás?, how are you? The s on the end of estás there is this informal s. Puedes. So, 'can't you come?' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> ¿No puedes venir?</span> <br> ¿No puedes venir? 'Why can't you come?' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> ¿Por qué no puedes venir?</span> <br> ¿Por qué no puedes venir? 'I want to know why you can't come' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> Quiero - oh to know. Ok I'm going know and knowledge and that's not taking me anywhere.</span> <br> Boy's got savvy .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> Ah, yes.</span> <br> So, 'I want to know' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Quiero saber</span> <br> Quiero saber. 'Why' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Por qué</span> <br> 'You can't come' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> No puedes venir</span> <br> Very good. Very good. If you address each part, part by part, and apply all of our mental energy just to the part we need and then forget it. 'Quiero saber por qué no puedes venir'. Very good. So to recap, we have -ar verbs and we have -er/-ir verbs. For all of the verbs, we take off the ending, -ar, -er, -ir, and we put -o for the 'I' version. So 'vender' is to sell and 'I sell' is .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Vendo</span> <br> Vendo. Comprar is to buy and 'I buy' is .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Compro</span> <br> Compro. Good. Llegar is to arrive. Llegar. And 'I arrive' is .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> Llegaro ..oh </span><span class='ans'>llego</span> <br> Llego. Good. So with this rule we can take any verb and we can do this if it's regular. Maybe it's irregular and we try it and we make a mistake. So for example, salir is to leave or to go out. If we apply this rule, what are we going to come up with? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> Salo</span> <br> But it's wrong; it's salgo. So it's one of those -go instead of -o like vengo, I'm coming .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Tengo</span> <br> Tengo, I have; salgo, I leave, I'm going out. The quite common verbs, we tend to find in all languages that the most common verbs are the most irregular. Esperar, esperar, means to wait and to hope. Which is interesting and it's accurate enough. I mean you're not doing much more than waiting when you hope. We have it in the word 'desperate' actually. Des- is un-, and you're hopeless when you're desperate. So esperar is to wait or to hope. How do you say 'I'm waiting', or 'I'm hoping', or 'I wait', or 'I hope' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Espero</span> <br> Espero. Now how do you say 'he waits' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> Espere</span> <br> I'm really glad you made that mistake actually. Because it's a wonderful point to elaborate on. Before we touch a verb, we want to take one split-second to go esperar: -ar verb. Otherwise what happens? Our brain hears /e/-/e/ from esperar, and it wants to put an /e/. What your mind is doing there, putting an e because you have espe- and it fits better, is actually even ingrained in other languages. For example, in Turkish you have something called vowel harmony. And when you're adding on suffixes, there's like two or four, depending on the suffix, two or four different versions of that suffix that you can add on so it can agree with the vowel before. So there's something in your mind that would prefer an e there. Of course because it's espe- and like I said you even see this formalized in other languages, like in this phenomenon of vowel harmony. So to stop that process from happening, you must run back to the 'to' form and then you take control .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Espera</span> <br> Espera. And espera means he/she/it/you (formal) wait or are waiting, is waiting. We can build the rest. So how do you say 'they wait' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Esperan</span> <br> If you want to say they're waiting for me, we don't need the word for 'for', it's just like they await me. We don't need the word for for. So how do you say 'they await me' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> Esperanme - sorry .. </span><span class='ans'>me esperan</span> <br> The only option there because it's a changed verb. Me esperan. 'They're not waiting for me' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> No me esperan</span> <br> Good. No me esperan. 'I want to know why they're not waiting for me' . I want to know .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Quiero saber</span> <br> Why .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Por qué no me esperan</span> <br> Very good. Quiero saber por qué no me esperan. Well done .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> I was just very happy that I remembered saver finally.</span> <br> Ah good. Saber though with a 'b' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Saber, ah.</span> <br> Good .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> Isn't it from savvy?</span> <br> Yeah there is a grey area between v and b. So it will change between languages. Actually a very nice example of this is the word for vocabulary. Vocabulary in Spanish is vocabulario. Vocabulario. It's spelled with a v. But the word for mouth in Spanish is boca, spelled with a b. Now of course vocabulario is coming from boca. Your vocabulary is your 'mouth-ulary'. This gives us another rule, actually. Words ending -ary will become -ario. So, necessary; .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Necesario</span> <br> 'Contrary' .. " ] ,

[
 [ " Track 14<br> What was 'to know' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Saber</span> <br> Saber. Good. What would 'I know' be, if it follows our rules? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> Sabo.</span> <br> But it's not. It's 'sé'. So it's an exception. S-e, sé. You might have heard 'lo sé' -- literally I know it. Because sé by itself is a bit short, so you often hear people saying lo sé, lo sé - I know it, rather than sé, sé, sé. So this is irregular, very irregular. S-e. But the rest of the versions of saber are regular. So how would you say 'he knows' or 'she knows' or 'it knows' or 'you (formal) know'.. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Sabe</span> <br> Good. So 'I don't know' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> No sé</span> <br> No sé. We said that quiero was I want, and quiero actually is an -er verb so how would you say 'I don't know what he wants' What is 'what' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> qué .. No sé qué lo quiere</span> <br> Why lo? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> He</span> <br> Firstly, you're not using the word for he, you're just saying he wants and that's contained in the verb. But lo is not he, it's him. Not he. We didn't learn yet the word for he. On purpose actually we haven't been learning these words so that we can just use the verb for now .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> Ok</span> <br> So try again: 'I don't know what he wants' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> No sé qué quiere</span> <br> Good, you must feel comfortable with two words becoming one. I don't know what he wants, no sé qué quiere. Good. The word for he is 'él' . E-l. If you want to be emphatic: I don't know what HE wants, or if you want to show or clarify who you're talking about, you can add that. So how would you do that? 'I don't know what he wants' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> No sé qué él quiere</span> <br> Good. No sé qué él quiere. Or you can say no sé qué quiere él. You can do either; one sounds more emphatic than the other, and this is much better understood in live practice. Because the emphasis isn't just in the sentence, it's with the hands and facial expression and tone of voice. So it's something much better to get live. No sé qué él quiere, no sé qué quiere él. The word for she, what is the word for her first? We want to differentiate. What is the word for her, like in I want to see her? How would you say 'I want to see (to view) her' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Quiero verla</span> <br> Good. Quiero verla. But if you want to say she sees, it's not her, I want to see her, it's she. And the word for she is 'ella'. Ella .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Ella</span> <br> Now this is spelled e-l-l-a. Double l in Spanish is pronounced /yuh/. Ella. So if you want to say 'she sees', to see is a verb, what type of verb is it? -ar verb, -ir verb, -er verb? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> Ver. It's an -er.</span> <br> An -er verb. It seems too obvious to us .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> Sorry I thought you might be asking something more complicated.</span> <br> No. This is an -er verb. So how do I say 'she sees' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Ella ve</span> <br> Ella ve. And if I know who I'm talking about I can just say ve. Maybe when we are contrasting in the sentence we have a special desire to use these words. When I say contrasting, I mean in the sense maybe I say 'I want to invite him, but she doesn't want to invite him'. So even if we know who I'm talking about, there I will probably use the word for she because I'm making that contrast. <br>Again these are things you just do very naturally without realizing it once you get practicing. Also because your native language probably does the same thing as well. Even if you don't have the choice whether or not to put she - like in English you always put it - you will stress it with your voice. I don't want to invite him, but SHE does. <br>So because you are stressing that with your voice in English, that's also going to carry over. Many things are going to carry over that are positive language transfer that we might not necessarily address specifically. So how would you say that? 'I don't want to invite him, but she does want to invite him'. So, 'I don't want' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> No quiero</span> <br> 'To invite him' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Invitarlo</span> <br> Good. No quiero invitarlo. 'But' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Pero</span> <br> Pero. She does. So actually we can just say 'but she yes'. What was the word for 'yes' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Sí</span> <br> Sí. So we can just say 'but she yes' . How would you do that? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Pero ella sí</span> <br> Good. No quiero invitarlo, pero ella sí. Or maybe I even use the word for I there to be emphatic. Yo no quiero invitarlo. Yo: y-o. Yo no quiero invitarlo, pero ella sí. <br>So we said that salir was to leave or to go out. Now, I leave or I go out is 'salgo'. It's irregular, has the /g/ sound popping up. Salgo. But the rest of the versions are regular, so let's make them. How do you say 'he goes out' or 'he leaves' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> Sele?</span> <br> Again you're making some Turkish vowel harmony here .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> Sorry, what's the to?</span> <br> Salir .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> So it's seli- No</span> <br> Salir .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Sale</span> <br> Sale. Good. So that sele you put before is because it just sounds better. The mind has some kind of desire for this vowel harmony. It's very interesting. Sale. Now you can make me the rest. They, or you (plural), you guys .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Salen</span> <br> And you (informal) .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Sales</span> <br> Sales. Good. Now if you want to say 'I'm going out to eat', how is 'I'm going out' again? So it should be salo but it was .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> Sango?</span> <br> Salgo .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Salgo</span> <br> Salgo. So the irregularity is the same as the other ones that we saw: tener, tengo: to have, I have; venir, vengo: to come, I come; salir, salgo. So how do you say 'I'm going out to eat' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> I'm not sure of the word out.</span> <br> This is the verb. The verb is to leave or to go out .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> Oh, salgo. Right.</span> <br> So you don't need the word for out .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Ok. Salgo comer. </span><span class='ans'>Salgo a comer.</span> <br> Why did you think of the a? I think you felt it. You felt that sense of movement. Good. So salgo a comer, it's a verb of movement. Good. Voy a comer, I'm going to eat. Salgo a comer, I'm going out to eat. Very good. What was 'I have' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Tengo</span> <br> Tengo. I have it .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Lo tengo</span> <br> Lo tengo. Good. I have them .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Los tengo</span> <br> Los tengo. Good. If we add on que to tengo, and there's not really any comfortable translation for this, but if we add on que we get 'I have to, in the sense of must, have to. So for example if you say 'tengo que comer' you get 'I have to eat'. <br>So we change the meaning of tengo: like have, which is just possession, to have to by adding que. Like I said there is no comfortable translation. Que is what or that, it's also used as that. We're going to use it like this later, but again it's still very uncomfortable to translate. So we will just say we add que and we get the meaning of have to. <br>So how would you say 'I have to do it' ? What was 'to do'? Begins with a silent h .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Hacer</span> <br> Hacer. So, 'I have to do it' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Tengo que hacer .. hacerlo.</span> <br> Good. Tengo que hacerlo, lo tengo que hacer, you have the option. So we've seen a few verbs with this -go business. Vengo, I'm coming; tengo, I have; salgo, I leave; and we've seen that the -go just pops up for the 'I' version. It doesn't pop up for the other versions, this g. So, tiene for example is he has. Tiene. How would you say 'they have' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Tienen</span> <br> Tienen. And how would you say 'you have', speaking informally .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Tienes</span> <br> Tienes. Good. So if I give you the version for he comes it's viene. So how would you say 'you come' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> Informal?</span> <br> Yes .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Vienes</span> <br> Vienes. The word for when is cuándo. Cuándo .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Cuándo</span> <br> 'When are you coming?' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> Informal, vienes.</span> <br> It's the English that's confusing you .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> ¿Cuándo vienes?</span> <br> Exactly. So don't let that English 'are you coming' confuse you. There's a lot we're doing in English there that we don't need to worry about for Spanish. ¿Cuándo vienes? 'When are you coming to eat?' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> ¿Cuándo vienes a comer?</span> <br> A comer, very nice. ¿Cuándo vienes a comer? When are you coming to eat? Tiene, what does 'tiene' mean? " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> Have</span> <br> But I need you to be more specific. I'm giving you more information then just have. Tiene .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> He/it/she or formal you</span> <br> Very good. Ella tiene. Ella tiene .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> She has</span> <br> Good. 'Quiero saber qué tiene' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> I want to know what you have</span> <br> What you have, or she, or it. Very good. We said that a very interesting detail about tener is that you can also translate it as -tain, when this -tain forms part of another verb in English. So to contain becomes 'contener'. So how was it has or she has? 'He has' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Tiene</span> <br> Yes. We saw that it was tiene. We haven't looked at why yet, but we've seen that it's a little bit irregular. In Spanish you can generalize this irregularity. How is 'I have' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Tengo</span> <br> Tengo. 'I obtain' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Obtengo</span> <br> Obtengo. Sounds rather formal in English, but in Spanish you might use it like get. I get it, lo obtengo. I obtain it. To put in Spanish is poner. Poner .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Poner</span> <br> That means to put. And with 'I put', you have the same business with this g popping up, so how do you think it sounds, 'I put' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Pongo</span> <br> Pongo. And poner is interesting like tener, because when we have -pose inside of a verb in English we can turn that -pose into poner, and we get the verb in Spanish. So the example would be compose becomes componer. So to compose is 'componer'. How would 'to suppose' be? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> Suposer ..</span> <br> So compose is componer. 'Suppose' is .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Suponer</span> <br> Suponer. And how do you think you would say I suppose? We want to generalize our irregularities in Spanish. So how was 'I put'? How was that? 'I put' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Pongo</span> <br> Pongo. So suponer, to suppose, becomes, for 'I suppose' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Supongo</span> <br> Yeah. Supongo. And you will hear supongo que sí, I suppose that yes. I said that que can also mean that. I suppose so, we say in English. In Spanish you say I suppose that yes. Supongo que sí. You will hear that. So we had componer, to compose; suponer, to suppose. <br>How would you say 'to impose'.. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Imponer</span> <br> Imponer. 'To expose' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Exponer</span> <br> 'To oppose' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Oponer</span> <br> Yes. I oppose it. 'I oppose it' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Lo opongo</span> <br> Lo opongo. I oppose it. Good. And 'I have' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Tengo</span> <br> Tengo. And we said we can add on que to get the meaning of have to. So if you want to say I have to see her, how would you say 'I have to see her' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Tengo que verla</span> <br> Good. We can say la tengo que ver or tengo que verla. Both are fine. How would you say I must see her, 'I owe to see her' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Debo verla</span> <br> Debo verla. Or where else would you put that la? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> La debo ver</span> <br> Good. La debo ver. The difference between tengo que and debo is exactly like English. We use must when it's a bit more serious: I must see her. And we say have to like an everyday kind of thing. The way you use it in English and Spanish is exactly the same. So debo is a little bit more severe, a little bit more serious, and tener que, to have to with que, is more everyday. Tengo que comer ahora. What does that mean? 'Tengo que comer ahora' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> I have to eat now.</span> <br> Good. I have to eat now. What does it mean if I say voy a intentar comer más tarde? 'Voy a intentar comer más tarde' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> Voy is I'm going.</span> <br> Yes .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> Intentar? Can you say the whole sentence again?</span> <br> 'Voy a intentar comer más tarde' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> It sounds odd, because it sounds like I'm going with the intention to eat later.</span> <br> Good, but it's not a noun. It's not the intention. It's not la intención, it's intentar. And when you hear that -ar on the end, you can suspect that it's a verb. Most of the time it's going to be. So you want to something. Voy a intentar .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> I'm going to intend ..</span> <br> I'm going to try .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> Ah.</span> <br> I'm going to try .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> To eat later.</span> <br> Exactly. I'm going to try to eat later. Good. So let's make a very short recap on these useful verbs that tend to have verbs coming after them in this way, like voy a. So we had voy a: I'm going to. <br>I can? It might help to know that the word power is related to this word in Spanish. Of course when you can, when you're able to, you have the power to. <br>So it's related and it begins with p. 'I can' ..

 [ " <span class='ans'> Puedo</span> <br> Puedo. Good. Voy a comer: I'm going to eat. Puedo comer - what does that mean? .. " ] ,

 [ " Track 15<br> What was the word for 'what' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Qué</span> <br> And do you remember how was 'to pass' ? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Pasar</span> <br> Pasar. And this can also mean like to happen. To pass in the sense of to occur. How do you say 'he passes' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Pasa</span> <br> Good. And 'she passes' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Pasa</span> <br> And 'it passes' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Pasa</span> <br> Good. And if you want to say what passes, meaning what happens, what's going on, 'what is happening?' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'>Ah, I remembered it now. I went through the whole process and I remember people saying ¿qué pasó?</span> <br> This is the past. We said that when you emphasize that -o on the end it's actually the version for he/she/it in the past, so ¿qué pasó? is what happened?, and we will look at this later. But what is what's happening? 'What is happening?' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> ¿Qué pasa?</span> <br> Good. So if you want to say I want to know what's going on, I want to know what's happening, 'I want to know what's passing' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Quiero saber qué pasa</span> <br> Quiero saber qué pasa. I want to know what's happening. Good. <br>There's one more thing we need to know about the present, and it's gonna fill in, happily, a grey area for us which you might be wondering already: how did we get tiene he/she/it/you (formal) has or have, and then the other versions tienen, tienes, from tener? To want is querer. What is 'I want' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Quiero</span> <br> Quiero. So how does querer become quiero? <br>So there's something else we need to know about the present to understand this, and then we can manage the present completely. So what's happening is that when we have an e in the 'to' form of the verb like in tener: to have, like in querer: to want; when we have an e inside of the verb it's part of the root, not part of the ending. Not that -er, that doesn't count. But the /e/ in ten- and the /e/ in quer- of querer. <br>When we stress it, when we emphasize it, it often splits; most of the time, it splits into an ie under the stress of that accent, under the stress when we say querer we have the accent on the end, we have the accent on the ending. Then when we take off that -er we put -o, we would have quero but when we stress down that e it splits and it becomes quiero. <br>The same for tener: we would have tene for he has, but when we stress down on that e it splits and it becomes tiene. The same for come. We have venir. But when we say he comes, she comes, it comes, you (formal) come, it would be vene, but it becomes viene. <br>Now it's not happening with tengo, vengo, because we can say the n and the g kind of hold it up. So this is probably why it got saved. But otherwise it splits. <br>Now, this might seem quite an abstract thing to get your head around, but what is very helpful is that we have these between words in English and Spanish. <br>We can identify these between words in English and Spanish. For example, we have a word that we use for time in English, but only in music.<br> Do you know what is this word? A word we use for time but only in music. When you speak about the time, the rhythm of music, you talk about its .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> Beat</span> <br> Not beat but tempo. Now, time in Spanish is tiempo. You see the difference between tempo and tiempo, other than the Spanish pronunciation, is that the e has split into ie. So you can even see it between words in English and Spanish. Concert in Spanish is -- try and do the same thing .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Concierto</span> <br> Concierto. Good. <br>You stuck in an o to make it sound more Spanish and you split that e. Concierto. <br>November is Noviembre. <br>So this will help us remember. So this happens most of the time.<br> We already saw places that it doesn't happen; we saw very briefly the verb llegar, which was to arrive and we said llego, I arrive.<br> We saw esperar, which was to wait or to hope, espero. It's not happening. <br>But most of the time it's going to happen. <br>We saw it happening with tener which became tiene, he/she/it/you (formal), tienen, they or you (plural), tienes, you (informal). <br>We saw it happening with venir, to come: viene, vienes, vienen. <br>Another verb that we see this way is 'pensar'. what do you think 'pensar' means? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> Thoughtful</span> <br> But it is a verb. There is no verb to thoughtful, is there? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> Well, to think</span> <br> Yes that's it, to think. It's very useful for us to group words into families. So 'verb' is a family. So when you decide what type of word it is, then you narrow down the possible behaviors of that word, and you manage to manage it much easier. And making that very clearly - that connection - is really really helpful for you. To think, pensar. So if you say 'I think', how is it going to be? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Pienso</span> <br> Good. It would be penso but you stress down on that e and it splits into ie and you get pienso. How is 'he thinks' or 'she thinks' or 'it thinks' or 'you (formal)' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> Piense</span> <br> This sounds like vowel harmony. I mean it sounds nice, piense, because we have ie and then we want to put an e next to it because it matches. But that's Turkish grammar. You must know where you are with any verb. And to know where you are you must go back to the 'to' form. Then you are confident .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> So it's piensar.</span> <br> Pensar .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Pensar</span><span class='ansEng'>, not penser.</span> <br> No, pensar. So you must go back there and then you feel confident. Otherwise the base is going to effect what vowel you want to put on .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Piensa</span> <br> Piensa. You (informal) .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Piensas</span> <br> Good. 'What do you think?' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> ¿Qué piensas?</span> <br> Yeah. ¿Qué piensas? This is a useful verb as well actually. Because if you say I think to eat it means I plan on eating. You can say I think to eat, that simple. 'I think to eat': how would it sound? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Pienso comer</span> <br> Pienso comer. I think to eat later is I plan on eating later. So how would you say 'I plan on eating later' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Pienso comer tarde</span> <br> That means I plan on eating late, which is fine, but later is more late. And more is related to massive .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Más tarde</span> <br> Good. Pienso comer más tarde. I plan on eating later. So you can use it like that as well. We saw venir also splits with the exception of vengo. He comes, 'she comes', you (formal) - how would that be? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Viene</span> <br> Viene. They .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Vienen</span> <br> Vienen. You (informal) .. " ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'> Cúando</span> <br> Cúando. 'When are you coming?' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> ¿Cuándo vienes?</span> <br> ¿Cuándo vienes? Entender means to understand. You can use comprender if you forget it, but entender is better. It's more common. But comprender is easier because it sounds like comprehend, and also in comprender the e doesn't split. I understand is comprendo. <br>But with entender it does split. So you can use comprender, but most common in Spanish is entender for understand. And here the e does split. So how would you say 'I understand' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Entiendo</span> <br> Entiendo. How would you say 'he understands .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Entiende</span> <br> Entiende. Good. They .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Entienden</span> <br> Entienden. Perder means to lose. It's kind of related to perish, there is a connection there, or perishable food. You know, food that rots, or real food. Perder, to lose. 'I lose' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Pierdo</span> <br> Pierdo. Good. The process is perder-perdo, maybe it splits: pierdo. Good. 'I lose it' .. " ] ,

 [ " Track 16<br> Comenzar, what do you think that means? Comenzar .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> To commence</span> <br> To commence. Or? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> To start</span> <br> To start. Again this exists and you can use it and it's probably easier because it sounds like commence so it's easier to remember. But there's another verb which is more common, which is empezar. Empezar This is a z so that's going to sound /th/ in Spain, empe/th/ar in most of Spain. Empezar .. " ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'> Empiezo</span> <br> Empiezo. He starts .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> Empieze</span> <br> What must you do before you make that decision? What must you do? <br>You must go back to the 'to' form. It's a very important habit .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> It's empezar. </span><span class='ans'>Empeza</span> <br> Good. And then what might be the next step after empeza? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Empieza</span> <br> Empieza. So this is the process we want to take. It's essential for us to get into that habit of going back to the 'to' form and then we know where we are. Otherwise it's guesswork. Empieza: empezar-empieza. 'They start' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Empiezan</span> <br> Empiezan. Good. You (informal) .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Empiezas</span> <br> Good. 'When are you starting?' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> ¿Cuándo empiezas?</span> <br> ¿Cuándo empiezas? Very good. <br>So the e can split to ie; that's something we need to know about the present and it's something we need to be on top of. Now it's in the present that this happens because, as we know, one of the fundamental elements of the present tense is to have that accent on the penultimate syllable. <br>So it's having that accent on the penultimate syllable that makes that e vulnerable to splitting. The e might split to ie, or the o might split to ue. <br>We know this already actually because we have puedo, and this is a split o. To be able, or 'to can', of course there is no 'to can' in English, to be able we say is poder. <br>Here actually you can see closer that connection with power. Before, I said that the word is related to the word power in English. <br>El poder - el is the masculine the - we also saw it's the word for he, it's also the word for the for masculine words. El poder is the power. <br>So here it's a noun. It looks like a verb, but if it has the in front of it, we know it's a noun. El poder - the power. Poder - to be able.<br> When you take off your ending and you change it for present tense, and you stress that o, it splits into ue, and you get puedo. <br>Again we can see the same phenomenon happening between words in English and Spanish. So, for example, we have the word port in English, but we say Puerto Rico. <br>Puerto Rico means 'the rich port'. Rico means rich or nice or tasty or sweet. So port becomes puerto. We see the o is splitting into ue. <br>We have the word force in English, in Spanish this is fuerza. We have the word school, in Spanish this is escuela. <br>We have corp in like corporate, which means body. If corp means body in corporate, how do you think it is in Spanish? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Cuerpo</span> <br> Cuerpo. Good. <br>We have innovative, and this nov in innovative means new. <br>When you do something innovative, you do something new. And the word for new in Spanish is nuevo. So you saw the o splitting there. <br>You might have heard pueblo before. Pueblo means a village or a people. <br>Population in Spanish is one of these exceptions. It's not populación, it's población. <br>And you can see the connection between población and pueblo, which means village or people. A people. You can see the o in pob- splitting into ue in pueblo. <br>Mortgage, by the way, actually means 'death pact'. You have mort-, which is the Latin root for death, and -gage, which means pact. <br>The word for 'dead' in Spanish is - have a guess .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> Muerto or </span><span class='ans'>muerte.</span> <br> Well actually, here, one you have the noun, la muerte is the death. <br>So the noun is the word you put the in front of. In school they tell you that it's the thing, the object. <br>But this is not an object. We would think of it, we put the in front of it, it's a noun. La muerte. <br>But then the adjective, which is describing, it's muerto or muerta. Or muertos or muertas. <br>So you can see in those words between English and Spanish this phenomenon of this o splitting into ue when it takes the stress. <br>So this is useful for us for present tense. We need to know this for present tense because if we have a verb like dormir, for example, that has an o in the root, when we stress it, it might split. <br>What do you think 'dormir' means .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> Staying still or dormant?</span> <br> Yeah, what does dormant mean? <br>A dormant volcano. It actually means it's a sleeping volcano. Or dormitory, this is a nice connection to make as well. <br>So dormir means to sleep. How do you say 'I sleep' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Duermo</span> <br> Duermo. Good. <br>In Spanish if you want to say I fall asleep, you can say I sleep myself. <br>So how would that sound? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Me duermo</span> <br> Me duermo. <br>Which means I fall asleep, rather than duermo, I sleep. <br>So you can say I'm falling asleep, me duermo. It's so boring, me duermo. <br>He sleeps .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Duerme</span> <br> Duerme. Good. <br>'They sleep' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Duermen</span> <br> Duermen. <br>What do you think 'encontrar' means? Encontrar .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> To encounter</span> <br> Good. <br>Which probably means .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> To meet</span> <br> Oh it does, it means that as well, but there's a more usual meaning as well .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> To find?</span> <br> Yes. <br>So 'I'm finding it' or 'I find it', how would you say that? .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> Lo, is it encuentro ?</span> <br> Yes it is .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Lo encuentro</span> <br> Good. <br>Something useful to bear in mind is that different versions of the verb, either the 'to' form or some other version, might be the noun. <br>So you mustn't assume always that it's a verb. <br>If you see un encuentro - an encounter - this is now a noun. An encounter. <br>Whatever we can put 'a' or 'the' in front of is a noun. <br>So, many times some version of the verb will be the noun. Un encuentro is an encounter but encuentro, I encounter. <br>Demostrar was to demonstrate, and if we get rid of this de-, we get mostrar which means to show. Mostrar. So how would you say: 'I show' .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> Mostro</span> <br> It would be mostro- .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Muestro</span> <br> Muestro. Good. He shows .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'> Muestre, wait. Mostrar. </span><span class='ans'>Muestra.</span> <br> Good. Muestra. <br>We don't need to roll the r here because it's just one r. Muestra. Good. <br>And una muestra actually is a sample. So there is a noun there that shares that version. <br>Muestra: he shows, it shows, she shows, you (formal) show. But una muestra is a sample. <br>They show .. " ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'> Muestran</span> <br> Muestran. <br>Good.<br>-- end of track --" ]
],
[
 [ "Track 17<br> So we've seen how two sounds in the verbs in the present tense might split when we put pressure on them. We've seen how e might become ie, so for example we have querer which means to want, but 'I want' is .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Quiero</span><br>Quiero. So we stress down on that e and it splits into ie. And this will happen for the other versions that we learned as well. So how do you say 'he wants' or 'she wants' or 'you (formal) want' .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Quiere</span><br>Quiere. They want .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Quieren</span><br>Quieren. Good. And you (informal) .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Quieres</span><br>Good. 'What do you want?' .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>¿Qué quieres?</span><br>Yeah. ¿Qué quieres? Good. So another example where this will happen is with the verb perder, which means to lose. It's related to perish. So how would you say: 'I lose' .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Pierdo</span><br>Pierdo. And 'he loses', 'she loses' .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Pierde</span><br>Pierde. 'They' .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Pierden</span><br>Good. And 'you (informal)' .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Pierdes</span><br>Pierdes. Good. So we saw that the e can split into ie, and we also saw that an o in the base of the verb can split into ue. So we saw, for example, poder is to be able. And then we have puedo, I can, I am able. We had dormir, what did 'dormir' mean? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'>'To sleep'</span><br>Good. And 'duermo' .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'>'I sleep'</span><br>Good. What changed when we added me? 'Me duermo' .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'>I think it's I fall asleep.</span><br>Yes. I sleep myself, I fall asleep. Good. So we can expect to see these o's split, but not always. For example, to eat was? To eat .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Comer</span><br>Comer. And 'I eat' .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Como</span><br>Como. So it didn't split there. So there's no way to know where it will, where it won't. Most of the time it will and you just have to kind of experiment and see what happens. And you will always get the feedback when you try to see if it splits or not. You'll also develop an intuition of where you should do it. So colgar, for example, is to hang. So if you want to say 'I hang' .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Cuelgo</span><br>Cuelgo. Good. 'He hangs' .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ansEng'>Well the reason you explained before with the- because it has an /e/ sound before, it seems to go more.</span><br>Exactly, it fits more. So you will find yourself doing that. How do you get out of doing that, how do you stop that happening? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'>By going back to the 'to' version of the verb.</span><br>Exactly, and then you're in control. Colgar, -ar verb, cuelga. Good. They hang .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Los cuelga</span><br>Good. Los cuelga. Words in English that begin al-, so not end -al like normal, normal, metal, metal, they begin al-, they come from Arabic. This al- means the in Arabic. And in Arabic it's written with the word. It's written as one word. It's all stuck together. So when words came in from Arabic they kind of came in most of the time with this al-, which meant the. So for example, alcohol, and when we say the alcohol, we are actually saying something like 'the the alcohol', something like this. The verb to take is tomar. Tomar. T-o-m-a-r. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Tomar</span><br>Tomar. And this is also used like to drink. So it's used like take generically, generally, but also to drink. How would you say: I don't drink alcohol, 'I don't take alcohol' .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>No tomo alcohol</span><br>Good. No tomo alcohol. Sugar in Spanish is azucar. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Azucar</span><br>Azucar. Or in Spain because we have a z here, it will be /athucar/ in most of Spain. Now, this is also an Arabic word, and it's the same word as sugar in English. Might not look like it. What's happened here? In Arabic, the l of al - the word for the - assimilates, changes to match the next letter if the next letter is kind of close to it. It does this with about half the letters. So in Arabic actually, instead of alzucar, you say azucar. And this passed into Spanish. But in English we got the word without the 'the' at the beginning this time. This time sugar came in without the the at the beginning. So they look kind of different, and sound rather different: sugar, azucar. But again they're the same word. So how would you say: 'I don't take sugar' .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>No tomo azucar</span><br>Good. No tomo azucar. Arroz, rice, is also an Arabic word. It's actually al ruz, the rice. But again in Spanish, the l assimilated to the next r, as it does in Arabic and instead of al ruz like in arabic, arruz, we ended up with arroz. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'>So it's two r's?</span><br>Two r's. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'>So is azucar with two s's?</span><br>Nope. It's with a z here because two s's are not a combination you find in Spanish. So for example, in the word possible, we have two s's there in English. But in Spanish when we write posible, we write one s. The same with passion; we write one s in Spanish, pasión. So you don't get two s's together in Spanish. But you do get two r's together to differentiate between the normal r and the rolling r. So in Spanish we have a-r-r-o-z. It's just assimilation of al ruz: arruz, to Spanish arroz. And it's the same word that's in English, rice. So how do you say: 'I want rice' .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Algebra</span><br>Algebra. Good. Spanish has a lot more Arabic than English. The south of Spain was part of the Muslim world for 800 years, so the languages had a lot of contact. And you get more words in Spanish that you don't have in English that are from Arabic. So for example, aceite, oil. In Arabic this is zet. Aceite. Aceituna, olive, zetun in Arabic. Alfombra, which means carpet, almohada, which means pillow, all of these words they came in from Arabic. When you find al- at the beginning, with maybe a couple of exceptions, it's from Arabic. So we said I take is tomo. How is: 'he takes', 'she takes', 'it takes', 'you (formal) take' .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>¿Qué tomas?</span><br>¿Qué tomas? To drink exists. It's beber, beber. And the word drink, the noun: una bebida, a drink. Una, we have a for feminine words - una bebida or la bebida, the drink, comes from beber. But tomar, to take, is extremely common. They take .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Toman</span><br>Toman. Good. Now there's one more version of the verbs that we didn't learn yet, which was the 'we' version. We didn't learn how to say we want or we have. Now we take is 'tomamos'. Explain to me what I did then to get we take. If I go from tomar to 'tomamos', what am I doing? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'>You took out the -r and put a -mos at the end.</span><br>But to make it fit in with your- .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'>Well you took out the -ar, the -ar sound, and you put in the -amos sound.</span><br>Good. This is very nice to think about it this way because then you fit it in with what you've been doing up until now. Taking off the -ar, a-r, and putting in your ending. So you take off -ar and you put on -amos and you get the 'we' form. So, how is: 'to speak' .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Hablar</span><br>Hablar. And 'we speak' .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Hablamos</span><br>Hablamos. Good. So with -amos we're adding on two syllables, and the accent is going on the second last syllable. So it's in a different position, that accent, to the other versions. If we look at tomo, toma, toman, tomas, tomamos, the accent is moving. Again, 'to speak .." ] ,

In English and in Spanish we have three ways to talk about the past, or three main ways to talk about the past. We can say, for example: I ate. We can say: I was eating. And we can say: I have eaten. <br>Now, when we say I have eaten, we are using I have, which is the present, and then eaten is like a version of the verb which is kind of complicated in English.

Now, the verb that we use for have in the sense of I have eaten, I have gone, in Spanish it's 'haber'. <br>Haber: h-a-b-e-r. And of course we have the silent h there, in haber. Haber is to have in the sense of I have eaten. But haber is extremely irregular, there is no 'habo', it is extremely irregular.

 [ " <span class='ansEng'>/a/ and /e/</span><br>Good, we have /a/ and /e/ inside the word haber, and we are going to use that to help us remember the versions. Let's start with 'he' .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>He</span><br>All by itself, it means I have. It is spelled h-e. And of course, we have the silent h there from haber in he (h-e). I have. We actually saw already one other verb that forms its I version in this way. What was 'to know' .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Saber</span><br>Saber. And 'I know' is? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Sé</span><br>Sé. I have from haber is spelled h-e, just like sé from saber is spelled s-e. They are the only two verbs that form the I version in this way, in this very irregular way. So you get sé from saber, and you get he from haber. Different from saber, all of the versions of haber are irregular. Now, I and we are connected. We can see how we is the plural of I. I, and then when I include you and I say we, it is like the plural of I. So, I and we are connected. So, just knowing that, if you had to guess what is 'we have', knowing that 'I have' is 'he', what do you think you would guess? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'>Hes?</span><br>This works with nouns and adjectives. So, it is a very good example of why, whilst we are avoiding grammatical terminology, we want to know what type of word we are dealing with, because different words behave in different ways. Nouns, words you can put 'the' or 'a' in front of: la semana, una semana- the week, a week; and adjectives, words that describe, that you can put 'is' in front of: is red, is tall: these words use -s for plural. But we have never seen the verb do that, have we? What does the verb use for we? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>-amos</span><br>Or? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>-emos</span><br>Or? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>-imos</span><br>And what do they have in common, -amos, -emos, -imos? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'>The -mos</span><br>Good, ok. So if 'he' is 'I have' (h-e), how do you think it might be 'we have' .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Hemos</span><br>Hemos. Good. So, from haber you get he and hemos, no? And we don't want to memorise this, like we said we can think just this thought, just the thought 'What vowels do we have in haber? /a/ and /e/. Ok: he. He by itself is I, it is connected to we: he and hemos.' <br>Now we go to the other vowel /a/. H-a all by itself (h-a) 'ha' means 'she has', 'it has', 'he has, you(formal) have'. Now I am sure you can tell me the rest of them. What are the other versions? What is they have? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Han</span><br>Good. So, we start with this base of he and ha, and we can remember that just by looking at the vowels that are inside haber. And then, we can add on what we need. So, we have he for I have, hemos for we have, we have ha (h-a) for he/she/it/you (formal) have or has, you added an -n and what did you get? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Han</span><br>And what does that mean? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'>They have</span><br>Or? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'>You guys have</span><br>Good. And how would you say you have informally? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Has</span><br>Has. Good. And that is your set: he-hemos, ha-has-han. So you have two key vowel sounds /e/ and /a/. He-hemos for I and for we (for I and the plural of I which is we). And then you have ha for he-she-it, han for they, has for you (informal). Now we need to learn how to make eaten, how to make gone, how to make wanted, if we want to say I have eaten, I have gone, I have wanted. This is very simple in Spanish. -ar verbs will lose their -ar, they will lose their final -ar, and they will put -ado on the end. So for example, we have to speak which is hablar. If you want to build spoken, you take off that -ar and you put on -ado. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Hablado</span><br>Hablado. Now we can speak about the past. Now we can say I have spoken, and we need to think about the two bits separately. 'I have spoken' .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'>Is it he? </span><span class='ans'>He hablado</span><br>Very good. He hablado. I haven't spoken. Where do you think the no is going to go? 'I haven't spoken' .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'>In the beginning</span><br>Good .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>No he hablado</span><br>Very good. No he hablado. I haven't spoken. 'We have spoken' .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Hemos hablado</span><br>Hemos hablado. 'He has spoken' .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Ha hablado</span><br>Good. 'She has spoken' .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Ha hablado</span><br>Good. They? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Han hablado</span><br>You (informal)? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Has hablado</span><br>Perfect, well done. Now, this is actually more useful, this past, than what you might think it is, because this is used even more in Spanish than it is in English. So maybe you want the past I spoke, but you can use, for now, I have spoken. This 'have past' is very popular and used much more than in English. So, how would you say 'anticipation' .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Anticipación</span><br>Good, and 'to anticipate' .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Anticipar</span><br>Good. How would you say we have anticipated it? So, there is a few things you have to think about. Think about them separately, then put them together. 'We have anticipated it' .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'>Hemos anticiparlo</span><br>So, to get anticipated you take away the -ar, and you put -ado. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'>Ah! Yes. Hemos anticipado lo</span><br>And where does that lo go? Because anticipado is not like - .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'>Ah! It has changed now, so it is in the beginning.</span><br>Yes. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'>So, </span><span class='ans'>lo hemos anticipado</span><br>Good. Lo hemos anticipado. The word for 'for', like in time, 'we have anticipated it for a long time' for example, is 'por'. Por .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Por</span><br>You might know 'por favor', which means 'please' in Spanish. Which means 'for a favour'. Por favor, 'for a favour'. So this por is also for, in the sense of 'for periods of time.' So, if you want to say 'we have anticipated it for a long time', we will just say 'we have anticipated it for much time'. And maybe there are some bits in there that you think you don't know. But we will see when we get to them. So, the first bit is 'we have anticipated it' .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Lo hemos anticipado</span><br>Good. For .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Por</span><br>A lot or much .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Mucho</span><br>Time. We saw briefly before that we have a word in English that we use for time, that we only use with music. What was that word? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'>Tempo.</span><br>Tempo. And how did it change in Spanish? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Tiempo</span><br>Tiempo, yes! The e split. So: we have anticipated it for a long time. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Lo hemos anticipado por mucho tiempo</span><br>Good. Lo hemos anticipado por mucho tiempo. Very good. Maybe you want to ask somebody Did you celebrate? And you think 'oh, I don't know 'did' yet in Spanish'. You can just say: Have you celebrated? And that is fine. Like I said, it is used even more in Spanish than in English. <br>So, some certain situations it might sound a little bit uncomfortable the translation into English. But in Spanish, most of the time, it is going to be fine. So, 'have you celebrated?' Let's speak informally. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Has .. celebración .. celebrar .. celebrado.</span><br>Good, good. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'>So, </span><span class='ans'>¿has celebrado?</span><br>Good, ¿has celebrado? 'Haven't you celebrated?' .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>¿No has celebrado?</span><br>'Why haven't you celebrated?' .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Dónde</span><br>Dónde. 'Where have you celebrated?' .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>¿Dónde has celebrado?</span><br>Good. 'Where have you celebrated it?' .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>¿Dónde lo has celebrado?</span><br>Good. So, -ar verbs, we take away the -ar and we put -ado. And we get this version of the verb that we need after haber, which in English has many different forms. Like I said: you have gone, wanted, eaten .. it changes a lot. But in Spanish we get rid of the -ar and we put -ado. We said that to take, and also sometimes to drink, is tomar. Tomar .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Tomar</span><br>So how would you say 'I have taken .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>He tomado</span><br>He tomado. Good. 'We have taken' .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Hemos tomado</span><br>Good. Has she taken it? 'Has she taken it?' .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'>¿Han lo tomado?</span><br>That is a guess, you are looking at me like it is a guess - I want you to establish your own thought process of how you are going to find it. So what is the first bit you need to think about? Has she taken it? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'>Has she.</span><br>Good. What is that? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'>Ok, so it is he and hemos for I and we.</span><br>Yes. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'>So it is.. oh! It is ha! It is just </span><span class='ans'>ha</span><br>Yes. So, 'has she taken it?' .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>¿Lo ha tomado?</span><br>Sometimes I am going to build you up step by step, sometimes I am just going to give you the sentence and you need to deconstruct what thoughts you need to have first, and to divide it up into various thoughts to get the sentence, resisting any temptation to guess or to say something that we are not sure of. <br>You can be sure and be wrong, there is no problem there, eh? But we want to think about it, dividing the sentence up into each individual thing we need to think about. First, she has, 'ha'. She has taken, 'ha tomado'. She has taken it. It is lo, where do I put the lo? Before the changed verb. Lo ha tomado.<br>-- end of track --" ]

 [ "Track 22<br>So, we were learning how we can use the present to talk about the past, using haber, which is to have, in sentences like I have gone, I have eaten. What do you think terminar means? Terminar .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'>To terminate</span><br>And what verb would we use more commonly in English? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'>Finish?</span><br>Finish. Terminar is to finish. Do you remember how to say 'I have' from haber? We can look at the two vowels we have in haber, and this will set us off. .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>H-e</span><br>H-e. Good. And that h comes from haber, that silent h that you have there. Good. So, how would you say I have finished? Firstly, how do you make finished? How do you get the word finished from terminar? .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ansEng'>Or before everything, everything else?</span><br>Before the changed verb. So this is the way you want to think about it. If we simplify the thought to 'at the beginning or at the end', when there is other words there, we might be really confused about where we can put it. So, we must think 'after the complete verb', the 'to' form, or 'before the changed verb'. So if you say he lo terminado, you've actually got it after a changed verb, you put it after he. So, this is a very rare situation in Spanish, where we have two changed verbs together: he terminado. We see, usually after a changed verb we get a complete verb: quiero terminar, I want to finish; puedo terminar, I can to finish; debo terminar, I must/I owe to finish. So, here we have two changed verbs together, he terminado, weird situation, which means there is only one place it can go. .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ansEng'>Whether it is an -e - there is no -edo?</span><br>No. Like I said, there is only one difference between -er and -ir verbs, in all of the Spanish language, only one occasion where they are doing things differently and that was in the present for we.

So, that might confuse us in Spanish because in English it doesn't change, but all we need to understand is that tú goes in the group of él, ella, yo: tú (you); and te is in the group of those little words, lo, la, me: te.

 [ " <span class='ans'>Usted</span><br>Usted. Which is the formal you, it is actually a contraction of vuestra merced, which means your honour. Something like this contracted to usted. So this is the formal you. So how would you say 'you see' talking formally? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Usted ve</span><br>Good. You see it (talking formally) .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Lo ve usted</span><br>Or usted lo ve. It can be either way. The word order in Spanish is much more flexible than in English. Lo ve usted. Usted lo ve. Either way. How would you say you see them (still talking formally)? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'>Usted ve los.</span><br>Ok .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ansEng'>Sorry! </span><span class='ans'>Los ve</span><br>Good. Usted los ve. Good. So, usted is flexible. Los is not flexible. Usted los ve. Los ve usted. Now, the word for they, the word for they is ellos (e-l-l-o-s, and this l-l in most Spanish dialects makes a /y/ sound. You might hear /ezhos/ around Río de la Plata in Buenos Aires of Argentina; Montevideo, Uruguay. You might hear like a /j/ kind of sound in Colombia /ejos/. But in the great majority of the Spanish speaking world double l and y make /y/: /eyos/ or /eyas/. I am sure you can work out the difference between the two.

 [ " <span class='ans'>Ellos me ven</span><br>Good. Ellos me ven. So we are understanding that we have two separate groups of very important words. The set of: yo, él, ella, ellos, ellas, nosotros, tú, and usted. Yo veo. Tú ves. Usted/él/ella ve. Ellos or ellas ven. And nosotros vemos.

Now, if we look at why these words ending ma are actually masculine, it's going to help us internalize it. So these words that end ma actually come from Greek. Problema in Greek is provlima. System in Greek is systima. In Spanish, it's sistema. So how would you say 'the system' .." ] ,

So when they went into Spanish, or into Latin, they got mistaken as masculine words. So if we can identify them, there's a key group of words we can avoid committing this error with. If it ends ma, it's probably from Greek and probably masculine. So how would you say the system again? .." ] ,

 [ " Track 25 <br> So we've seen how me can mean me, to me or myself and te can mean you, to you or yourself. And nos can mean us, to us or ourselves. So we want to resist the temptation to translate this to. So for example: he speaks to me, we don't need this to because me, me, can mean me, to me or myself.

 [ " <span class='ans'>Comprar.</span><br>Good. So this me other than to me can be for me, from me, we don't really need these words. So for example, if we want to say he buys it for me we can just say he buys me it. So comprar is to buy. He buys it for me, he buys me it .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>¿Te lo compro?</span><br>Yeah! ¿Te lo compro? Shall I buy it for you? Now this could actually even mean from you. Shall I buy it from you? So by the context we will understand the difference. Maybe you will hear if you travel to a Spanish speaking country people say 'buy me', selling things in the street. 'Buy me something' is what you will hear. And they are probably not asking you to buy them something but to buy something from them. And it's understood and we don't really need to use these words like from or for most of the time. To do was hacer, hacer. How would you say do you want to do (speaking informally)? .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>He cocinado.</span><br>He cocinado. Good. So we said that this tense of have cooked, I have cooked instead of I cooked, we can use it more in Spanish than in English. So for example in English it sounds much more natural to say I cooked at 6 o'clock, but in Spanish it's not a problem to say I have cooked at 6 o'clock. So, at 6 o'clock is a las seis. What you actually mean when you say a las seis is a las seis horas. 'At the six hours'. A little bit like in English when you say 'at sixteen hundred hours'. A las seis. So how would you say I have cooked at 6 o'clock? I cooked at 6 o'clock .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>He cocinado a las seis.</span><br>Good. He cocinado a las seis. I have cooked at six o'clock. I cooked at six o'clock. Good. The word for eight in Spanish is ocho. Ocho. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Ocho.</span><br>Ocho. We have this similar root in octagon, you know, a shape with eight sides. Or octopus, which has eight legs. Or in October, which, well now it's the tenth month, in the Roman calendar there were only ten months and October was month number eight. So, ocho, eight. How would you say we have cooked at eight o'clock? We have cooked at eight o'clock .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Hemos cocinado a las ocho.</span><br>Good. Hemos cocinado a las ocho. The word for nine in Spanish is nueve. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Nueve.</span><br>We can see in November, which used to be the ninth month. The o splits into ue, nueve. And we have the same with ten. Ten is diez or /dieth/ in most of Spain. Diez. What does that sound like, if you go back to our calendar? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>December?</span><br>December, which used to be the tenth month and of course again an example of splitting. Dec to diez. Quedar in Spanish, quedar, means to remain, or to be left over and it actually has quite a few other meanings as well, it's quite a flexible verb, quedar. But for now, to remain or to be left over. Q-u-e-d-a-r. Quedar. And q-u in Spanish is always a k sound. You must resist any temptation to pronounce /qwedar/, if you were to read this. The word que, the word for what that we learned is spelled q-u-e. Quiero is spelled q-u-i-e-r-o. So q-u this combination is always a k. Quedar means to remain. So in Spanish if you want to say I stay actually you say I remain myself. This is the way you say I stay in Spanish. So we start with remain which is quedar. So how do you say I remain? .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Quedo?</span><br>Quedo. I remain myself? .." ] ,

Until the view, literally until the seeing, until we see each other. Hasta la vista. So now you can say I am staying here until ten o'clock. So let's divide it up. I am staying here, I remain myself here .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Voy a quedarme.</span><br>Good. Until seven, until seven o'clock. Seven is siete, similar to the beginning of September. September in Spanish actually is either Septiembre or Setiembre. You have two versions of it in Spanish, Septiembre with the p, or without the p, Setiembre.

 [ " <span class='ans'>Automobile.</span><br>Of course, and it exists: automóbil. But people will say auto. You might even hear máquina, which means machine. So machine, the car, máquina. This is another example of the q-u spelling producing k sound. M-a-q-u-i-n-a. Máquina. .." ] ,

Big, in Spanish, is grande, grande. Of course we can relate this to grand in English, grande. So using any of these words that you like, how would you say, the big car? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>La máquina grande.</span><br>Good. La máquina grande. So la máquina grande, el auto grande. Now if you say the big cars, this adjective is also going to become plural. How do you say the house? .." ] ,

Now you would probably be quicker at building can you see than you see because can is something very common that you're going to be using all the time.

You will notice that yourself and your speech will adjust, but in the beginning what you're trying to do is to be conversational and correct structurally. Once you get over that hurdle of being communicative, you're going to start noticing that people say things differently to you. So instead of I can't find it, I don't find it.

The moment we come in contact with a verb, we know exactly what to do. We know it's a verb, and we know how to manage it. We don't start trying to make a verb masculine or feminine, for example.

 [ " Track 29 <br> So I want to talk about something now that's different in Spanish. And first I want to speak about what this means; rather than an obstacle to learning, it's part of the experience of learning a new language which can make you realize that in your own language you are both permitted and obliged to perceive and express the world in a certain way. There's two important, kind of contradictory concepts here almost. It permits you and obliges you, it allows you and requires you, to perceive and to express the world in a certain way. So, in Spanish we have two verbs for to be. So remember to be is is, am, are; we get all of this from to be. We don't say I be; we say I am. So we have ser. This is where es comes from; this is where son comes from. And ser is about characteristics. When we refer to the characteristics of something. Actually un ser is a being. We said that some form of the verb is often the noun; here it's the complete form. Un ser is a being. Un ser humano is what? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>A human being.</span><br>A human being. And we could have found humano, even though there's no rule to find humano, that word, we have humanity. The words with -ity end how in Spanish? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Humanidad.</span><br>Humanidad. And then we can probably guess then that human is humano. Un ser humano is a human being. So ser refers to things that are characteristic of something. Then estar, which is the other to be, estar, refers to states - states we are in. The word state is related to estar. So Spanish permits us, allows us, but also obliges us, when we are perceiving and expressing the world around us, to make a decision and to think about something. Is this a state, or is it a characteristic? So this kind of sounds very abstract right now, so let's look at some examples. To be tired: do you think this is a state? Or do you think it's a characteristic of you, to be tired? Is it a state you're in, or is it a characteristic of you? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>It's a state.</span><br>Good. Where you are: is it a state you are in or is it a characteristic of you? Where you are. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>A state.</span><br>A state. To be a good or a bad person: do you think this is a characteristic of you or a state? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Characteristic.</span><br>Characteristic. So it's very very important to kind of snub out now any temptation that you might have to simplify this to temporary and permanent. This is what most learners do, and actually what many teachers do: simplify this concept to temporary and permanent. Which, if you think about it this way, will work most of the time, but not all of the time. We want to think in this way, is it a state or is it a characteristic? For example if I say I am a student, it's not very permanent is it? But is it a state or a characteristic? My profession or my occupation. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>It should be a state you're in.</span><br>It's temporary but that doesn't make it a state. Your profession, according to Spanish, is characteristic of you. Even if you do it for five minutes. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>I guess it's the same, for example, as you said before with the word aggressive. Someone can be aggressive and they can change, so that stops it from being permanent. But it's still a characteristic.</span><br>Exactly. And we will see actually some adjectives we can use with both ser and estar to give different meanings. But the great bulk of them go with one or the other. This is Spanish conceptually deciding whether it's a characteristic or a state; forcing us to make this differentiation and to express it. Let's look at the forms, lets look at the forms of estar to begin. Now I am from estar is estoy. Estoy. So it ends -oy. We already saw another verb that ends -oy which is voy: I go or I'm going. Estoy. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estoy.</span><br>Estoy. Now to be is a very irregular verb in most languages. Look at English: from to be we get am, is, are, was. But this is actually not so irregular. We have this little irregularity -oy, estoy. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estoy.</span><br>And the other irregularity that we have is that this verb is the only verb in the entire Spanish language that doesn't have the accent on the penultimate syllable in the present tense. So it's not 'éstoy' it's estoy; the accent is on the ending. This hasn't happened until now, and it won't happen again. So we have estar and from estar we have estoy. Now, all of the other forms are regular. We build them how we would expect to, with the exception that the accent will be on the last syllable. And it's the only verb in the entire present tense that has this characteristic. So how would you say he is / she is / it is / you are, from estar, using estar? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Está.</span><br>Está. They or for you guys .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Están.</span><br>Good. And make it for you (informal) .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estás.</span><br>Good. And for the 'we' version, the accent is where it should be because we're adding two syllables. So give me the 'we' version. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estamos.</span><br>Estamos. So that's it, that's your set. Estoy, está, están, estás, estamos. The word for tired is cansado, cansado. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Cansado.</span><br>C-a-n-s-a-d-o. Cansado. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Cansado.</span><br>Good. So how would you say, I am tired? This is a state. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estoy cansada.</span><br>Good. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estoy cansada.</span><br>Estoy cansada. Good. We are tired, talking about a mixed or a masculine group? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estamos cansados.</span><br>Good. Estamos cansados. What if you are an all female group? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estamos cansadas.</span><br>Good. Now the word for always we said was siempre. Siempre. Now if you say, I'm always tired, because tired as an adjective, as an idea, is a state, not a characteristic, because we are looking at that whether it's a state or a characteristic, rather than is it permanent or is it temporary, we're using estar. So even if you say I'm always tired it doesn't matter, you still use estar. So siempre is very flexible in this sentence, you can put it anywhere. The emphasis is going to change when you move it, but it's legal anywhere. So how would you say, I'm always tired? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estoy cansada siempre.</span><br>Good. Estoy cansada siempre. Estoy siempre cansada. Siempre estoy cansada. Or I would say cansado. Good. So we want to resist the temptation to simplify this concept to 'temporary' and 'permanent'. We want to ask ourself 'is it a state, or is it a characteristic?' To be tired: is it a state or is it a characteristic? If we simplify it to temporary and permanent, most of the time it's going to work, this simplification. But many times we're going to feel frustrated, feeling like there's something we don't understand because Spanish disagrees with us. If we have the concepts of characteristic and state, the few times Spanish disagrees with what we consider a characteristic and state it's going to be an interesting point of perspective. For example, muerto. Which means .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Dead.</span><br>Dead. Good. We looked at this briefly before as a part of mortgage, meaning death-pact. Muerto, in Spanish, is a state. Death is a state. So if you want to say I'm dead, you would use estar. So how would you say that? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estoy muerta.</span><br>Good. Estoy muerta. And I would say estoy muerto. And you can use it to say, I'm very tired as well. Estoy muerta, estoy muerto. I'm very tired. Good.<br>-- end of track --" ]

 [ " Track 31 <br> We spoke about how we have two verbs for to be in Spanish, estar and ser. And we practiced with estar, which is the verb that we use for states. And we said that the word state is related to estar. Actually, it's like the same word. What looks most different there between state and estar is that /eh/ that you get at the beginning of estar. But you will find this actually with words that start st-, sp-, s- and consonant. You can't begin a word like this in Spanish, where you can in English. So, actually, you will find many words between English and Spanish that get like an extra e at the beginning in Spanish. For example, the word Spanish in Spanish is Español. Or Spain, which is España. Student - estudiante. School - escuela. There you have the o splitting of school to ue. Escuela. Special - especial. Spatial .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Espectacular.</span><br>Good. Espectacular. So this is the difference that we see between state and estar. So we said that estar we use with what we will consider states of being. Now with what we consider characteristics of being, we will use ser. And we said that ser, all by itself, means being. Un ser is a being. Un ser humano is a human being. Here, humano is acting like an adjective, so it's coming afterwards. But it could also be a noun. We can say the human. How would that be? The human .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Soy.</span><br>So like estoy from estar, it ends o-y. There are just four verbs in the whole spanish language that use oy instead of o, for I. Voy, doy from dar, to give, doy, I am giving, and then estoy and soy. <br>So we said that student is estudiante. So if you wanted to say I am a student .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Es posible.</span><br>Es posible. Good. So we have es. Es is from ser. Now, ser is more irregular than estar. Doesn't look like es is from ser, not too much. And then we had they are, or you guys are. What was that? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Son.</span><br>Son. Good. So, we've got three of the versions now. Soy, son, and es. We can take son and we can work out the 'we' form from son, working backwards.

 [ " <span class='ans'>Aburrido.</span><br>Now this is boring or bored. One of these words in English is a characteristic and the other one is a state. Which is which? Boring, if I say you are boring, is it a state or a characteristic? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Characteristic.</span><br>And if I say you are bored, is it a state or a characteristic? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>A state.</span><br>A state. So in English we have two different words to express this difference whereas in Spanish you will just decide whether you are going to use ser or estar. So, you will have to think about it. How will you say, it is boring? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Es aburrido.</span><br>Es aburrido. Good. He is bored, is it a characteristic or a state? .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Son aburridos.</span><br>Son aburridos. They are bored .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Están aburridos.</span><br>Good. Están aburridos. So with some adjectives we get a different meaning depending on whether we use ser or estar. The word for from in Spanish is de. From or of, de. De. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>De.</span><br>We get this forming part of many Latin-English words, for example, deliver. The de- of deliver is actually from. -liver is to do with freedom, like liberation, liberación. How would you say to liberate? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Liberar.</span><br>Good. Libre is free in Spanish. So again we see this grey area between v and b, between English and Spanish, between libre and -liver in deliver just as we did between savvy and saber for example, so deliver is like from or of freeing, which has much more sense if you look at the original meanings of deliver, like to deliver a baby, deliver me from evil, rather than to deliver a package, which is a much more modern meaning. You can see much more the ideology in the vocabulary with the older uses. Another interesting word that we can see this de in, in English, is decipher for example. Decipher is actually a combination of Arabic and Latin. You have de meaning of or from, and 'cipher' from 'sifr' which means zero in Arabic. So to decipher is to go from zero, or something like this. So anyway we have de for from or of. Now, if I want to ask, where is he from? Is it a characteristic or a state, where you are from? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>A characteristic.</span><br>Yes, it's not where you are, it's where you are from, this is characteristic of you. So in Spanish we are going to say, from where are you, from where is he, from where is she? This is the word order. So, 'from where' is what? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>De dónde.</span><br>De dónde. From where is he? From where are you (formal)? et cetera? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>¿De dónde es?</span><br>¿De dónde es? And you informal. You remember how was you are, you informal. It's kind of similar to es .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>¿De dónde eres?</span><br>¿De dónde eres? So this sentence actually will help you remember this kind of irregular form eres because you will hear it all the time. ¿De dónde eres? From where are you, where are you from? How would you say, where are they from? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>¿De dónde son?</span><br>¿De dónde son? But if you want to ask, where are they? Their location, where are they? How would you ask? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>¿Dónde están?</span><br>Good, ¿Donde están? Because now we refer to a state. Good. So, we have this adjective as well, libre, like in deliver and liberation, libre, which means free. Again, we might mean a state or we might mean a characteristic. Now sometimes, to show the difference, we might not just use ser and estar, we might actually also change the way we say it. So for example, if you want to say I am free, and you mean from your exams, from work, do you think you mean a state or a characteristic? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>A state.</span><br>A state. So how would you say that, I am free? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estoy libre.</span><br>Good. Estoy libre. And libre does not change for masculine and feminine because it ends e. Only adjectives ending o will change. Estoy libre. Good. Now if you mean as a characteristic, as a characteristic of your personality, you are a free person, then you might say .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Soy libre.</span><br>Soy libre. You might also say, I am a free person. So person is persona, and you could say, I am a - what's a person? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Una persona.</span><br>Good. I am a free person .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Soy una persona libre.</span><br>Good. Soy una persona libre. Persona is feminine, not because of you, because the word is feminine. So I, as a male, would also say, soy una persona libre. So it's the noun in itself, persona, that is feminine. So in this case, with libre, there's no problem to move between ser and estar. You can use libre with ser or with estar to give slightly different meanings. So some adjectives you will be able to move between ser and estar and others you won't. If you want to get around that uncertainty, instead of trying out soy libre you could just say soy una persona libre, and then because persona is going with soy, because what you are saying in fact is, I am a person, soy una persona, then you know you are safe. Also, different Spanish dialects can have different ideas about what should go with ser and what should go with estar. So for example, casado, which means married, not cansado, casado, comes from casa, which literally means housed. When you are married you are housed. Casado, in some places they use with ser and in some places they use with estar. They can't agree on whether being married is a characteristic or a state. If you want to avoid this insecurity about it you can say, soy una persona casada, and then you know that persona is going with soy, so whatever then describes persona is not important. Persona goes with soy. When you say I am a person, then that is characteristic. Let's explore this idea a little more. Busy in Spanish is occupied, ocupado. Ocupado. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Ocupado.</span><br>Good. How do you say, I am busy? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estoy ocupada.</span><br>Estoy ocupada. Or I would say, estoy ocupado. Now, if I want to say, I am a busy person, then with this adjective, actually, I can't switch to soy, and say soy ocupado. That's bad Spanish. But you as a Spanish learner, how are you supposed to know that? So, you can use persona as a safety net, in the sense of I am a busy person, and then you're sure it's perfect Spanish. So how would you say I am a busy person? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Soy una persona ocupada.</span><br>Good. Soy una persona ocupada. So that's a characteristic, because what you are actually saying is, I am a person, and much more characteristic than that you can't get. So, estoy ocupado, as a state, and then soy una persona ocupada, characteristic, males or females would say persona ocupada. Ocupada refers to persona, not to the speaker, so I would also say, soy una persona ocupada. How would you say, we are busy? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estamos ocupados.</span><br>Estamos ocupados. But if you wanted to say, we are busy people .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Somos personas ocupadas.</span><br>Good. Somos personas ocupadas. To be worried is to be preoccupied. So how do you think that would sound? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Preocupado.</span><br>Preocupado. I am worried .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estoy preocupada.</span><br>Good. He is worried .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Está preocupado.</span><br>Good. He is a worried person. He is worried as a characteristic. He is worryful .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Es una persona preocupada.</span><br>Good. Es una persona preocupada.<br>-- end of track --" ]

[
 [ " Track 33</span><br>So some adjectives will exclusively go with estar. Some adjectives will exclusively go with ser. Some adjectives can go with either ser or estar, and change their meaning, like aburrido, meaning bored as a state, or boring as a characteristic, just changing depending on whether it goes with ser or estar. Another example of a word like this is listo. Listo. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Listo.</span><br>Now listo, when it comes with estar, means ready. So how would you say I am ready? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estoy listo, or lista, in my case.</span><br>Estoy lista, or listo. How would you say, we are ready? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estamos listos.</span><br>Good. And what if we were a female group? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estamos listas.</span><br>Estamos listas. And what if we wanted to emphasize We are ready .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Somos, no,</span><br>You make it a characteristic and it's more emphatic .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Nosotros-</span><br>It's a very interesting idea. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>It's what you said when I go too fast. So it's nosotros estamos listas.</span><br>There's a contradiction there. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Nosotras estamos listas.</span><br>Yes. All-female group: nosotras estamos listas, or male or mixed group: nosotros estamos listos. So, to be listo, to be ready as a characteristic, means to be smart in Spanish. So this is one of the words that we can use with ser or estar and the meaning changes. So, estoy listo: I am ready. Soy listo: I am smart. So if you want to say, he is smart, he is smart, how would you say it? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Es listo.</span><br>Es listo. She is smart .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Es lista.</span><br>Good. You are smart, speaking informally, to a woman? If you forgot the you are you can think of where are you from? That might help you trigger it. De dónde- .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Eres. Eres lista.</span><br>Good. You are very smart .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Eres muy lista.</span><br>Good. The word for so, like I am so bored or I am so tired, is tan. T-a-n. Tan. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Tan.</span><br>So how would you say, I am so tired? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estoy tan cansado. Cansada.</span><br>Good. Estoy tan cansado. Estoy tan cansada. Good. How would you say, I am so bored? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estoy tan aburrida.</span><br>Good. Estoy tan aburrido, aburrida. How would you say, he is so bored? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Él está tan aburrido.</span><br>Good. Está tan aburrido, or Él está tan aburrido. Now how would you say, it is so boring, it is so boring. So boring, not bored. Boring. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Es tan aburrido.</span><br>Good. Es tan aburrido. The word for good in Spanish is bueno. We've mentioned this before. We have in English Bon Appetit which is of course French, but we say it in English, and you can see the o of bon appetit splitting to become bueno in Spanish. Now the meaning of bueno changes as well between ser and estar. If you are talking about it is, the change is a kind of change in feeling. Es bueno, está bueno: a small change in feeling which really depends on dialect so we won't look at it too much here, we'll just listen. But if you refer to people, in most dialects, if we use ser, we get the meaning of 'to be a good person' or 'to be good at something'. So if you want to say, they are good, and you mean 'they are good people', or that they are good at something, how would you say it? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Son buenos.</span><br>Son buenos. He is good .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Es bueno.</span><br>Es bueno. Now if you use estar, it will sound like he is attractive. He is in good form. So bueno with estar, if we are talking about people, then gives you this meaning. So how would you say that? He is good, meaning attractive, in good form .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Está bueno.</span><br>Está bueno. So, you see that you can have many different changes in shade of meaning between ser and estar. So other than the fact that we are being permitted and obliged to perceive and express the world in a certain way by Spanish, which is very interesting in itself, we also get the opportunity to use these different nuances between ser and estar and when you really get your head around it, which is just through listening and observing and seeing how people are using it, you will probably feel that it's missing in English. That sometimes in English you might want to clarify, not estar but es, and you can't do it. So you realize that Spanish gives you a tool to relate to reality that in this case, English doesn't give you. And this is one of the most fascinating and exciting things about language learning. Not an obstacle to speaking the language, we don't want to see it like this, oh every time I use to be I have to think about this 'characteristic or state' business. No, we want to look at it from the other angle, about what it offers us. How would you say, I want to know how he is, and we mean, I want to know, how is he doing? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Quiero saber cómo es.</span><br>How is he doing .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Oh. Cómo está.</span><br>Good. Quiero saber cómo está. Now what would it mean, quiero saber cómo es? What would that mean? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>How he is. What he's like.</span><br>Exactly. I want to know what he's like. Good. Another adjective you can use with ser or estar is feliz. What do you think feliz might mean? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Happy.</span><br>And how do you know that? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Feliz navidad.</span><br>Oh okay! Happy Christmas. Feliz navidad. But is there some connection in English that might have helped you as well? Did you hear felicity in English? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Yes.</span><br>How would felicity be in Spanish? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Felicidad.</span><br>Felicidad. Which means happiness. Happiness. So feliz, happy. So feliz can also go with ser or estar to give the meaning of I am happy or I am a happy person. So we don't need to say I am a happy person, we can just use ser. So like I said there's no real way for you to know that other than listening. If you wanted to play safe, and say, literally, I am a happy person, it would not be at all incorrect. So, firstly, how do you say, I am happy, as a state? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estoy feliz.</span><br>Estoy feliz. Now, I am happy, and you mean as a characteristic .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Soy feliz.</span><br>Soy feliz. So this is fine. You can do this, but there is no real way for you to know whether feliz is an adjective that is flexible enough to be used with ser and estar. It really depends on the adjective itself, the word itself, rather than the meaning in many cases. So, with that insecurity, and wanting to give the meaning, you could have just said, I am a happy person, and then you don't have to worry about it. So how would you say that? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Soy una persona feliz.</span><br>Good. Soy una persona feliz. And that's also perfect Spanish. So there you could have said soy feliz or soy una persona feliz. So to really get our heads around ser and estar it's important to listen actively, and to notice and see how people are using ser and estar, and making our own conclusions as to why, working with this base of state and characteristic. It's a process of listening, and the more you get intimate with this idea, it offers you a great range of expression that you don't have in English and you should really enjoy it.<br>-- end of track --" ]

 [ " <span class='ans'>Desayunar.</span><br>Breakfast and desayunar are direct translations of each other in fact. I don't know if you noticed that in English breakfast is 'break fast'. When we have breakfast we break the fast. And in Spanish 'des' is like un, ayunar is to fast. So to 'un-fast'. So desayunar is like to 'un-fast', to 'break fast'. Desayunar. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Desayunar.</span><br>To have breakfast. I'm having breakfast or I have breakfast .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Desayuno.</span><br>Desayuno. And desayuno is also the noun. El desayuno is the breakfast. What was to wait or to hope? Desperate is related because again we have this 'des' like in desayunar which is like 'un-hoped' or 'un-hopeful' is to be desperate. So to wait or to hope .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Esperar.</span><br>Good. Esperar. Good. What is I wait or I am waiting or I hope or I am hoping? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Espero.</span><br>Espero. So we've been giving the verbs two translations in the present tense. I speak or I am speaking, I go or I am going, I wait or I am waiting. This is because this –ing tense in English we really overuse it. For example we use this –ing in English to refer to the future: He is doing it tomorrow, whereas in Spanish we just use the present tense with that future context. Lo hace mañana. Which is why we need to give both translations for hace, for example. He makes or does or he is making or doing. And we translate hablo as I speak and I am speaking. But this doesn't mean that I am speaking doesn't exist. It does exist but we use it in Spanish only when we want to show what we are doing right now in this moment. So, beginning this structure I am speaking, this I am: do you think that you would choose ser for characteristics, or do you think that you would choose estar for states? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>It's a state so estoy.</span><br>Good. We will use estar because of course what we are doing is a state. So we will always use estar with these structures. So the first part of this sentence is estoy. Now to get speaking, –ing, from to speak we take off –r and we add –ando, -ando. And we get hablando. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Hablando.</span><br>So, I'm speaking .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estoy hablando.</span><br>Estoy hablando. Good. So maybe somebody interrupts you and you won't say hablo, you will say estoy hablando. How would you say I am waiting and you mean right now? Right now, I am waiting here, I am waiting here .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estoy esperando aquí.</span><br>Estoy esperando aquí. Good. So you could say espero aquí. Maybe it would sound a little more like I'll wait here rather than I am waiting here but both are fine. In many situations both are fine and there will be just a slight change in meaning. Espero aquí, estoy esperando aquí. What you can't do is say I am eating with her tomorrow. The –ing, you need to use it just for what you are doing right now. So how was to speak? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Hablar.</span><br>And how would you say I speak or I am speaking? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Hablo.</span><br>Hablo. And what was to prepare? If you forgot it you can go from preparation. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Preparación, Preparar.</span><br>And I prepare or I am preparing .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Preparo.</span><br>Good. So how would you say I am preparing it tomorrow? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Lo preparo mañana.</span><br>Lo preparo mañana. So if you want to show, if you want to emphasize that we are doing something right now, I am preparing, firstly if we divide that up into two bits: I am - preparing .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estoy.</span><br>Estoy. Good. Preparar becomes? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Preparando.</span><br>Good. So how would you say I am preparing? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estoy preparando.</span><br>Good. Estoy preparando. Good. So that's if you want to say I am preparing it right now, you can use this structure. So how would you say I am preparing it? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Lo estoy preparando.</span><br>Lo estoy preparando or Estoy preparándolo. Even though it's a changed verb here we can have the lo after –ando. Estoy preparándolo or lo estoy preparando. We said that to have breakfast was desayunar, desayunar. So how would you say we are having breakfast and you mean right now? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estamos desayunando.</span><br>-ando. Good. Estamos desayunando. So, for –ar verbs we take off the –ar and we put –ando and we get this tense to show what we are doing right now. And we are not going to use it as we do in English: I'm finding out tomorrow and I'm doing it next week, I'm preparing it later. How would you say I'm preparing it later? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estoy preparando-</span><br>This is not how we use it. So in Spanish we only use it to describe what we're doing right now. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Right. Sorry.</span><br>So this is why we are giving preparo, for example, the translation of both I prepare and I am preparing. So that when we want to say things like I am preparing it later, we don't go to estoy preparando. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Lo preparo más tarde.</span><br>Lo preparo más tarde. Good. But if you wanted to give the meaning of I am preparing it right now, how would you say it? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estoy preparándolo.</span><br>Good. Estoy preparándolo or lo estoy preparando. And there you get the meaning of right now in this moment. Good. So for –ar verbs we are taking off the –ar and we are putting –ando to get this –ing. For –er, –ir verbs we take off the –er or the –ir and we put on -iendo, -iendo, i-e-n-d-o, to get this –ing form. So how would you get eating from to eat? How would eating be from comer? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Comiendo.</span><br>Good. So how would you say I am eating, and you mean right now? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estoy comiendo.</span><br>Estoy comiendo. Good. I am eating. And how would you say he is eating or she is eating or you formal? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Está comiendo.</span><br>Good. Está comiendo. So maybe somebody calls you and they say Can I speak to Pablo?, and you say Está comiendo, you mean right now. What was to sell? You can think of vending machine. .." ] ,

 [ " Track 35 <br> So going back to ser and estar, and the difference between ser and estar, how would you say sincerity in Spanish? Sincerity .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Is it sinceridad?</span><br>It is. Sinceridad. So if you had to guess, what is sincere in Spanish, what would you guess? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Sencero.</span><br>Sincero. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Sincero.</span><br>Sincero. Good. So there's no rule for this, but if we have sincerity becoming sinceridad, we can guess that sincere will be very similar in Spanish and we can play around and try to find it. Sincero. Good. So do you think to be sincere is a state or a characteristic? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>It can be both, depending on the situation.</span><br>Indeed, but if you look at the concept, the concept of sincere - because this is how Spanish decides it - the concept of sincere, is it a state or a characteristic to be sincere? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Well if it's, generally it's a characteristic, but if someone, we're talking about that moment that someone is saying something, then in that moment, they're being, they're in that state of being sincere.</span><br>You're right, and our usage, and that's what we're going to look at now, can get around that, but Spanish is not looking at the use. It's looking just at the concept by itself, so sincerity, is it a characteristic or is it a state? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>It's a characteristic.</span><br>Good. So, it goes with ser. So if you want to say, I am sincere, how would you say it? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Soy sincero, sincera.</span><br>Good. Soy sincera. Good. And we are sincere .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Somos sinceras, if it's women.</span><br>Good. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Or sinceros.</span><br>Good. But, as you correctly said, you might want to say, I am being sincere now. So to give the meaning of I am being sincere, you will say, very literally, I am being sincere. How would you say that? I am being sincere .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estoy, I forgot the word for being.</span><br>Ser is to be, in this case because it refers to sincero, so how would you make that -ing? Vender, vendiendo. Ser .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estoy siendo sincero.</span><br>Or in your case it would be? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Sincera.</span><br>Good. Estoy siendo sincera. Or estoy siendo sincero. Honest in Spanish is honesto. Honesto. So how would you say, we are being honest? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estamos siendo honestos.</span><br>Good. Estamos siendo honestos. So to be honest, as an idea, is characteristic. But this doesn't restrict us in Spanish of course, if you want to say we are being honest, we can do that in exactly the same way as we do in English. We are: estamos, being: siendo, our characteristic to be: honestos. Estamos siendo honestos. Good! Salir is to go out or to leave. Salir. To go out or to leave, and it's irregular in that the I version is not 'salo' but, you remember how it was? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Salgo.</span><br>Salgo. Good. Salgo. I leave or I go out. Good. Soon, soon in Spanish is pronto. So you can say, I am leaving soon. Is soon right now? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>No.</span><br>No. So how would you say, I am leaving soon? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Salgo pronto.</span><br>Good. Salgo pronto. And how would you say, I am leaving tomorrow? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Salgo mañana.</span><br>Good. Salgo mañana. But if you want to say, I am leaving right now, and you mean this moment? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estoy saliendo.</span><br>Estoy saliendo. So we need to resist the temptation of the negative language transfer from English which will make us want to put -ing in many places where we don't put it in Spanish, which is why we are giving usually in the present tense both translations: I wait, I am waiting; I sell, I am selling. To buy was comprar. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Comprar.</span><br>I buy them, or I'm buying them. How would that be? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Los compro.</span><br>Los compro. Good. I am buying them tomorrow .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Los compro la semana que viene.</span><br>Good. Los compro la semana que viene. So again, here we would use -ing in English, I am buying them next week, but we want to resist that temptation in Spanish. Los compro la semana que viene. If you wanted to say right now: so maybe you get a phone call and somebody asks you, have you bought them yet? And you say, I am buying them now, how would you say that? .." ] ,

 [ " Track 36 <br> So we saw that we can use the present tense to refer to the future. For example, if we have some future context we can just use the present tense by itself. So we could say I am having breakfast with them tomorrow. Now in Spanish, you don't say with them. You say with they. With they. So how would that be, first? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Con ellos.</span><br>Good. And to have breakfast, we said, was to 'un-fast'. Desayunar, like in English breakfast, 'break fast'. So, I'm having breakfast with them tomorrow .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Desayuno con ellos mañana.</span><br>Good. Desayuno con ellos mañana. Good. And if we don't have a future context, like mañana or any other context showing us it's the future, we can also use I am going to speak about the future. So you can say I am going to have breakfast with them. How is that? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Voy a desayunar con ellos.</span><br>Good. Voy a desayunar con ellos. Good. And if we have the future context, it doesn't mean we have to say desayuno con ellos mañana. We could also say voy a desayunar con ellos mañana. The fact that we have future context doesn't mean we can't use voy anymore. So we've seen in that way we can use the present to talk about the future, but this doesn't mean that we don't have a future tense in Spanish. We do. Luckily, we don't have to learn any new sounds to master the future tense in Spanish. The future tense in Spanish is connected with the past tense that we learned of haber. Haber. This past of I have had breakfast or I have eaten, I have gone. So let's make a recap of the forms of haber. Now it's very irregular, haber, and we said that a nice trick to remember the different forms of haber is just looking at the two vowel sounds inside the verb haber. So what are those two vowel sounds? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>/a/ and /e/.</span><br>Good. Let's start with /e/. What does he mean by itself? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>I have.</span><br>Good. I have spelled h-e. And what other person is connected with I? What's the plural of I, let's say? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Hemos.</span><br>Good. We. So we have he for I have and hemos for we have. What is ha by itself? H-a .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>He, she, it, or you (formal).</span><br>Good. So give me the other two versions now. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Han.</span><br>Good. They or you guys. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>And has, which is you (informal).</span><br>Good. So that's our set. Let's practice a little bit some structures with haber just to recap. So what was to sleep? Dormant .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Dormir.</span><br>Good. So how would you say I have slept? Begin with I have .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>He dormido.</span><br>Good. We have slept .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Hemos dormido.</span><br>He has slept .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Ha dormido.</span><br>Good. How would you say to recommend? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Recomendación. Recomendar.</span><br>Good. So how would you say They have recommended it, they have recommended it, and I remind you that with these structures with haber, the it has to come before haber. There's no option of where to put it. So They have recommended it .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Lo han recomendado.</span><br>Lo han recomendado. Good. So these forms that we have, these forms of haber that we have – he, hemos, ha, has, han – are also the endings that we have for the future tense. So like I said, we will learn the future tense now without having to learn any new sounds. Now, the interesting thing about the future tense is that we take the verb in its 'to' form, where it's an –ar verb, -er verb, or –ir verb, doesn't matter, and we put the ending at the end of the 'to' form. And we stress the ending. We are effectively pushing the accent into the future. For example, we have comer, and what was I have from haber? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>He.</span><br>He. So that's the sound, without the h, just the sound /e/. That's the sound that we need for future for I. We add that on to comer and we get comeré, and that's I will eat. Now we are pushing the accent into the future, which might just seem like a coincidence. But you can notice that it happens in other languages as well, this phenomenon. For example, in Greek part of the past tense is to pull the accent back one syllable, to pull the accent back into the past. And actually, this is so important in Greek that if there is not a syllable there to do it, you add one to pull the accent back into the past. So this is a phenomenon that you see in different languages. The accents representing somehow or reflecting somehow the concept of time and tenses. So here we have pushing the accent into the future: comeré. I will eat. You can give me the rest of the versions for the future of comer. .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Preparar.</span><br>Good. And I will prepare .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Prepararé.</span><br>Good. So it's very important to think out the whole verb, preparar, and then add on the -e, prepararé. Because a very common mistake that learners make is to say preparé. And they miss out the last ar because they don't think out the whole verb first. So we must think out the whole verb first, preparar, and then add on the ending, prepararé. What was to wait or to hope? .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Organizará.</span><br>Good. Organizará. So the useful thing about the accent being on this ending is that we don't have to worry about where the accent goes when we're pronouncing the whole verb, organizará. On the end. Organizará. They will organize .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Organizarán.</span><br>Good. Organizarán. Good. What was tired? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Cansado.</span><br>Good. Cansado. So how would you say I will be tired? I will be tired .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Será.</span><br>Good. Sound familiar from anywhere? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Que será, será.</span><br>Yes. So very simple, the future tense. Doesn't matter if we have –ar, -er, or –ir verb. We are adding on these endings and these endings are the same as the different versions of haber. So if we forget them we can look back to haber and then we just add that on the end. But, in saying that, the future tense is not so often used in Spanish. Most of the time you will find yourself using present or voy a, vamos a.

The word for something is algo. A-l-g-o. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Algo.</span><br>Good. So how would you say They will give you something, and we mean informal you? Remember the thought process. The thought process must be, first, 'Who is doing the verb? Who is doing the verb?' They will give. That's the first place .." ] ,

Now, you get all of these different meanings with me, te, and nos, but the ones beginning with l, so lo, la, los, las, they do change to get these different meanings. So when we say to him or to her or to you (formal) or to them we go from lo and la and los and las to le and les. So lo and la become le, and los and las become les.

Now in English if I say He's cooking me something, I can say He's cooking me something or He's cooking something for me. Both are acceptable in English. So we're not looking for the direct translation, we're looking for the feeling more than anything. We want to identify the feeling of 'is it to me, is it for me, or is it directly me?' Is he cooking me? So it's the feeling that we want to get our heads around more than the direct translation of whether we're using to or not in English. For example, I listen to him. Here we're using to in English, with listen. But we don't use it with hear. I hear him. I listen to him. So we're not looking for direct translation of when we're using to and for or not. What we're trying to do is generally perceive, ok, am I being cooked? Am I being spoken? Am I coming out of somebody's mouth? Ah? Or is it indirect, am I being cooked for? Am I being given to? So, like I said, with me, te and nos it doesn't matter anyway, because they won't change. So if I want to say He's cooking me, and I mean he's directly cooking me in the oven, or if I mean he's cooking something for me, then the sentence isn't going to change anyway in Spanish.

So when we want this meaning of self or selves, we get se. So, to recap: me, te, and nos, they already have the meanings included of myself, yourself, ourselves, each other, but these ones that change, the small words that change, lo, la, los and las, to get the meaning of himself, herself, themselves is going to be se.

Quedarse is the version of the verb that you are going to find in the dictionary. So in the dictionary you will find quedar and all of the different meanings of quedar which is remain and the various other meanings, actually, this verb has, could be used like to fit. Me queda bien. It fits me well. It suits me well. And then you will find the next entry: quedarse. And then you will find next to it to stay. So when this reflexive, when this 'doing it to oneself' carries a different meaning, it will get a different entry in the dictionary. And it's not going to be in the dictionary as quedarme, or quedarte, or quedarnos, but quedarse because this se is also like oneself. No? If it's himself, herself, itself; it's also like oneself. So in the dictionary what you find is to remain oneself. Quedarse. The se is written like one word. Whenever we put se, lo, me, te, nos, one of these small words at the end of the 'to' form, it's written like one word. You write it all together. Let's practice this just with one more verb. We said that to get the sense of realize, I realize. In Spanish you say to give yourself account. Which is a little bit like to take acount of in English.

Now prepositions show some kind of movement or position; and they're very important and interesting words so it's useful for us to identify them as we did with verbs and adjectives and nouns.

So for me is para mí. Para mí. And you informal becomes ti. So for you, speaking informally, is para ti. So this is just after prepositions we get this mí and ti. M-i and t-i.

 [ " <span class='ans'>Lo quiero decir.</span><br>Lo quiero decir. So we see actually with this le, we are kind of replacing a preposition with le and les, an imaginary preposition: to, for, from.

 [ " <span class='ans'>Compro para ellos.</span><br>Compro para ellos. Good. So in an everyday situation, I'm buying something for them, les compro. Mostly we are going to be avoiding these prepositions, so he buys it for me. I'm just going to say he buys me it rather than he buys it for me. So how would you say that? He buys me it .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Me los compran.</span><br>Good. Me los compran. Good. Now, we said that these small words me, nos, te, le, les, most of the time what we are replacing with them is to, but sometimes it's like for, like to do a favor for, but they also might be replacing other prepositions like de. For example, if I want to say he buys it from me, I don't really need the from there either. I could just say he buys me it. So how would I say that? He buys it from me. He buys me it .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Me lo compra.</span><br>Me lo compra. So this is totally ambiguous. No? It could mean he buys it for me or he buys it from me, but it's something that we'll understand from the context. So the key point to take away from here is that we probably use prepositions much more in English than in Spanish and you just want to kind of like listen out for this and then you will start shedding them. You will start shedding your prepositions the more you listen to Spanish.<br>-- end of track --" ]

 [ " Track 40 <br> An interesting thing about prepositions is that they have a habit of changing between languages. To give you an example, in English we say I fall in love with. In Spanish, you say I enamor myself of. I fall in love of you. Now again, this is something that we look at with interest rather than looking at it as an obstacle, for the insight that it might give us about how we perceive and express the world through our own language. Now the fact that we use with is not necessarily casual. Casual in the sense of meaningless. The fact that we use with is not necessarily without its weight, without its meaning. If I say I fall in love with you, that preposition with necessarily involves you in my process of falling in love. Now this of is much more detached in feeling than with. So there is a school of thought which explores how these elements of language might have a real tangible effect on the way we interact with the world and with certain concepts and the way we express them and how that feeds back into the way we perceive and view the world. And I think this is a very nice example between falling in love with and falling in love of. So this is something to think about and just take interest in whenever you find that in Spanish the verb uses a different preposition than the one it does in English. Rather than just seeing it as a hurdle to correctness that you need to memorize, maybe have a little look at how it might actually be affecting, somehow or other, the way you perceive the world. This also helps the memory on a practical level. You are much more capable of internalizing and remembering this difference if rather than just mindlessly memorizing that you're using de instead of con here. We are looking with a more analytical eye, with a curious eye, to understand what effect this might possibly have on us and in this way we are just going to learn the differences much easier. Let's start with this verb: To fall in love is to enamor oneself. So if you look up in the dictionary to fall in love, what you will find is enamorarse, written as one word. Now it's important to realize that it is not one word. You still have a verb there ending -ar, enamorar and then the se is just hooked on. So let's start with I fall in love. How will you make enamorarse, I fall in love, I enamor myself? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Me enamoro.</span><br>Exactly. Me enamoro. Now if you want to say I fall in love with you, we're probably going to speak informally. In Spanish we're not going to say with you, we're going to say of you. I enamor myself of you .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Me enamoro de ti.</span><br>Yeah, me enamoro de ti. Very good. I fall in love with him .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Me enamoro de él.</span><br>Good. Me enamoro de él. If we want to give the meaning of I'm falling in love right now. We can say I am. How is I am, from estar? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estoy.</span><br>Good. Falling in love. Enamoring myself .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Enamorándome.</span><br>Good. It can come actually after the -ando or before estoy. Estoy enamorándome. Me estoy enamorando de él. Another verb that chooses a different preposition in Spanish and English is the verb to think. To think, we said it was related to the word pensive which means thoughtful. .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>En.</span><br>En. Good. So we say I think in you or on you. It's probably in, actually, because Arabic says it in this way and of course when languages come into contact, like the 800 years of contact that Spanish and Arabic had, they share a lot more than vocabulary. They also share structures. So we are probably saying I'm thinking in you to say I think about you, so how do you say that? I'm thinking about you or I think about you. Let's keep it informal. .." ] ,

Ñ is the only letter that we get in Spanish that we don't get in English and it's like an n with a little squiggly line on the top of the n and it's basically n-y. So n with squiggly line on top is n-y, like in mañana. Like in soñar. Soñar. To dream. .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Soñamos.</span><br>Soñamos, because we are not stressing it anymore. Soñamos, we are stressing the /a/. Very good. We don't say I dream of in Spanish. We say I dream with. So here we use with in Spanish. I dream with her. The language, we said, is permitting and requiring us to perceive and express the world in a certain way. So when we say, you know, I dream with her, maybe you can imagine that when people began to talk about what they were dreaming that they had the idea of the involvement of the other person. You know, I'm dreaming with you. You don't know, but it's interesting to think about how that change in the preposition can really affect the way we perceive the world. And then subconsciously, because even though our beliefs might have modernized, like if I dream about you I don't really think you're there, and I don't really think you are participating, but the language might hold an old belief that it is with you. That you are actually participating in my dream. So it's interesting to think about, and thinking about it is going to help your memory internalize just this simple fact that the preposition changes.

 [ " Track 41 <br> Let's look again at how we speak about the future in Spanish. We saw that we have a future tense but we might not use it very often because, firstly, we can just use the present to talk about the future if we have some future context: some word like mañana, tomorrow; later, más tarde, or even another part of the sentence which shows us that we are talking about the future, we can just use the present. When we don't have that we can use ir a, to go to, so voy a, vamos a, vas a, which is also present tense, voy, vas, vamos, it's present, but we can use it to talk about the future. So, for example, bailar, bailar, b-a-i-l-a-r, means to dance. We can relate it to ballerina, ballerina actually is just dancer in Spanish, bailarín in Spanish is dancer, so that's where we get ballerina from: bailar. So, if you want to say we are going to dance .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Vamos a bailar.</span><br>Vamos a bailar. Good. If you had some future context, like later, más tarde, or literally, more late, you could just say we dance later .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Bailamos más tarde.</span><br>Good. Bailamos más tarde. But you could have used that structure with vamos if you wanted to, you have the option. We can say bailamos más tarde or we could say we are going to dance later .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Vamos a bailar más tarde.</span><br>Very good. Vamos a bailar más tarde. So, we saw that we have a future tense, we have a future tense although we might not need to use it very often because we have this situation in Spanish that we can use the present, or that ir a, to go to, is used even more often than in English, this structure of I'm going to do it instead of I'll do it is used even more in Spanish than in English. But, we do have a future tense, and the future tense is luckily very related to the different versions that we found of the verb haber. Haber was a very irregular verb, this to have that we use to go into the past. What was the trick that we used to find the different versions of this very irregular verb haber? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>We used the vowels. The /e/ and /a/ sounds.</span><br>Good. We used these to take off from, we go: 'what are the two vowels in haber? /e/ and /a/,' okay. He by itself means .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>I have.</span><br>I have. And ha by itself means .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>He/she/it or you (formal) have.</span><br>Perfect. And from these we can find the other versions, so we have he for I have, and we have is .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Hemos.</span><br>Hemos. And we have ha for he/she/it/you (formal). For you (informal), what would we do to ha? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Has.</span><br>Has. H-a-s, completely silent, this h, this h that we find in all of these forms. They have or you guys have .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Han.</span><br>Han. So, these are our different versions of haber. Now, these very sounds, so, the sounds, because we are not including the h, the sounds /e/, /emos/, /a/, /as/, /an/ are the same sounds that we add on to the 'to' form of the verb to get this future tense. So, we have a verb like bailar, to dance. If I want to say I will dance, using this future tense, I can look at how is I have from haber, so, how is I have from haber? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>He.</span><br>He. And I can just stick it on the end. But it's the sound that is the same, what we are sticking on the end of the verb is an e, not the h-e. So, I will dance .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Is it 'bailáre' or bailaré?</span><br>The ending takes the accent and we said that in Spanish we are pushing the accent into the future, which is an interesting phenomenon, we spoke about, how in Greek, for example, in the past you pull it back into the past, so we find this phenomenon occurring in other languages as well. Here we are literally pushing the accent into the future and we accent that ending and we say bailaré, bailaré, I will dance. We will dance .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Bailaremos.</span><br>Bailaremos. He/she/it/you (formal) will dance .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Bailará.</span><br>Bailará. They or you guys will dance .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Bailarán.</span><br>Bailarán. And you (informal) .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Bailarás.</span><br>Bailarás. Good. So, we get the future tense without having to learn anything new, we just have to remember that we can look back at haber and see what the different versions of haber were, and then use them to build our future. So, in fact we have two future tenses, let's say, we have will and would, they are both future tenses. Now, -e, -emos, -a, -as, -an, they work for all verbs -er, -ir, -ar, it doesn't matter; they are all using these sounds to form will. And we have the same situation with would. -er, -ir, -ar verbs, they are all together. And our key sound for would is -ía. So, we add on -ía to the end of the verb, we are accenting it again, because it's pushing the accent into the future, and this –ía actually gives us I/he/she/it and you formal. So, here I is jumping in with he/she/it and you formal. So, bailaría, bailaría, means I would dance, he would dance, she would dance, you (formal) would dance, or it would dance if you can think of some context where that would make sense. I think you can work out what the rest would be. So, let's try. How would you say we would dance? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Bailariámos.</span><br>Good, the only thing is that the accent stays on the ía. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Bailaríamos.</span><br>Bailaríamos. Good. They or you guys .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Bailarían.</span><br>Bailarían. And you informal .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Bailarías.</span><br>Good. So, that's it, that's would. So they, would and will, share some characteristics, as they are both different futures. They share the characteristic that we are adding on to the full verb: bailar, bailaré: I will dance, bailar, bailaría: I would dance; and they share the characteristic that they are stressing the ending, that the accent is going to the ending, and they share the characteristic that for both futures we group all the verbs together: -ar, -er, -ir verbs, so for both futures we have one set of endings for all verb types. What was to go? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Ir.</span><br>Ir. Good. I would go .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Iría.</span><br>Yes, iría. So, this actually works for I, he, she, it, and you formal. So, in the would tense we have I jumping in with he, she, it, you formal. How would you say she wouldn't go? .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Transformaría la situación.</span><br>Transformaría la situación. If you wanted to say it would transform, and you mean it would get transformed, it would undergo a transformation, then in Spanish you will say it would transform itself. Now, in English we just use the context to understand whether we mean to transform something else or it would transform, it would get transformed, but in Spanish most of the time you are going to want to put that itself. What is that itself? .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Contamina.</span><br>Contamina. So, contamina would mean it contaminates, it's contaminating, maybe we are talking about the factory and we say contamina. If we want to say, it gets contaminated, we don't really have this gets in Spanish, so in Spanish to give this meaning of it gets contaminated we will just say it contaminates itself. Now, it doesn't mean that it's responsible for its own contamination or that it is literally contaminating itself, it's just the structure that we use to replace this gets that we don't have in Spanish. So, if we want to say it gets contaminated, and we are talking about the river, we will just say it contaminates itself, even though we all understand that what we don't mean is that the river is actually contaminating itself. So how would you say that, it contaminates itself, or it gets contaminated? .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Me imagino.</span><br>Me imagino. And here it doesn't really change the meaning. Sometimes adding this myself, or herself, itself, yourself, etc., doesn't really change the meaning very much. Imagino, me imagino, I imagine. How would you say I would imagine? .." ] ,

 [ " Track 42 <br> So we saw for would, the future tense of would, we have our key sound -ía, we have the key sound -ía which we are adding on to the end of the verb, and this gives you the version for I, he, she, it, and you formal. So, for this one we have I jumping in with he, she, it, you formal. So, we can take a verb like hablar and we can say I would speak. Hablar is to speak, and I would speak .." ] ,

It would be much better to translate gustar as to be pleasing. So, when you say I like it, what we want to say in Spanish is it is pleasing to me. That's the way we say I like it in Spanish, it is pleasing to me. So, if you take gustar to mean to be pleasing or to please, how would you make it is pleasing or it pleases? .." ] ,

So, if you are saying I like them, then of course what you are saying is they please me, so we must take this inter step, this Spanglish step, to think about it literally, to think it through literally, so we are sure that we are getting the meaning that we want.

With this very useful structure of habría, habrían, habríamos, would have, you could also say something like I would have liked it. You just need to think in this Spanglish, in this in between language, the literal translation of how we want to say it in English, and then convert it. So, I would have liked it is it would have pleased me. It would have pleased me.

 [ " <span class='ans'>Habría.</span><br>Good. Pleased. So it's gustar after haber. So maybe it's better to think of it in this way, 'I'm finding the version of the verb after haber,' instead of actually trying to find the translation of the word, because the versions after have are so different in English. We have eaten, gone, walked, so if we are looking for walked, gone, or eaten, and we forget that it's just the version after haber, we might be looking for a very long time, ah? So, the version after haber, we have -ado or -ido, no? .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>So it's nos habría gustado.</span><br>Very good. Nos habría gustado. And maybe, you might want to say we would have liked them.

 [ " <span class='ans'>Habrían. Nos habrían gustado.</span><br>Good. Nos habrían gustado, they would have pleased us, we would have liked them.

What was to owe, or must, which was related to debt in English? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Deber.</span><br>Deber. Good. -er verb. Deber. Now if you say would owe, this means should. How would you say then, I should, he should, it should, she should, you (formal) should? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Debería.</span><br>Yes. Debería. Good. How would you say you should come to my house? You should come to my house (informal) .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Deberíamos.</span><br>Good. How would you say we should speak? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Deberíamos hablado.</span><br>Here, speak is to speak. The confusion might come that in English, after can, after should, after must, we don't say to. I must eat, not I must to eat. I can eat, not I can to eat. In Spanish, you're just using the to form afterwards. So, we should speak, we should speak .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>El problema.</span><br>El problema. Good. We can see it ends in an a, so we would expect it to be feminine, but we saw that these words ending -ma in Spanish, many of them entered through Greek.

 [ " <span class='ans'>El esquema.</span><br>Very good. El esquema. We said that we cannot start s plus another consonant in Spanish.

 [ " <span class='ans'>Diagrama.</span><br>Good. And the diagram .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>El diagrama.</span><br>El diagrama. Good. So mostly, words ending /o/ are masculine and words ending /a/ are feminine, but we might find some exceptions. Planeta, for example, what do you think that means? Planeta .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Estas manos.</span><br>Good. We have this word in English, like in manuscript, manual, as well. Manual, manuscript, that man- bit there means hand. Maintain, which in Spanish is mantener. We have main- or man- means hand. Manage. Manage means to handle. Actually, it has a special use for handling horses, historically. Which is interesting, because to manage, manejar, is used in some Latin American countries to mean to drive. Other than to manage or to handle, it also means to drive, manejar, which is interesting because this verb manage historically had the special use to handle horses, and we see how that's kind of translated over the years to driving. How would you say Can you give me a hand? So this is a literal translation of something idiomatic in English, but it works in Spanish as well. In Spanish you say this. Can you give me a hand? And let's talk informally. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>¿Me puedes dar un mano?</span><br>But it's - .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Manejar.</span><br>And also to drive, in some Latin American countries. How do you say I am managing the problem, or I manage the problem? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Manejo el problema.</span><br>Good. So how would you say I'm managing the problem, and you mean right now. So I remind you that for managing, for -ar verbs to get this -ing, we take away -ar and we put -ando. And for -er/-ir verbs, for this -ing, we take away the -er or the -ir, and we put -iendo. First part is I am managing. I am managing .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estoy manejando.</span><br>Good. I am managing the problem .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estoy manejando el problema.</span><br>Good. Estoy manejando el problema. So mano, we said, ends in o and it's feminine. It's actually kind of the only true word that ends in o and is feminine. So, for example we have la foto, the foto. But foto is short for fotografía. So it's actually la fotografía becomes la foto. The same with la moto. The motorbike is actually la motocicleta. No? Then people say moto and foto and it stays with la. To take in Spanish is tomar. Tomar. .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Me gusta.</span><br>So, the 'to' version? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Gustar.</span><br>Gustar. Good. So how would you say we like it, and we want to take the route of the literal translation, so it is pleasing to us? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Nos gustamos.</span><br>So remember the first place you want your thoughts to go. This is very important, ah. .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Gusta.</span><br>Yes. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Nos gusta.</span><br>Nos gusta. We were saying that gustar, we can translate as to please or to be pleasing. Now it would probably make more sense for us to store it as to be pleasing. Because, if we want to say something like she likes it, what we will say is it is pleasing to her. So we have the to her with gustar, so that's why it makes more sense to translate it as it is pleasing to her rather than it pleases her. This way we store this idea of to. So what is to her? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Le.</span><br>Le. Good. So we have la for her, and to her, le. So if you want to say it is pleasing to her, or she likes it, how would it be? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Le gusta.</span><br>Le gusta. And it is pleasing to them, or they like it .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Les gusta.</span><br>Good. Les gusta. You had a little battle there, right, with whether it was gustan or not. Good. And you take control of that going it is pleasing, gusta. It is pleasing to them, les gusta. So with gustar, we're not using lo and la and los and las. We're using le and les. They like it, it is pleasing to them. Les gusta. How would you say they like them, or they are pleasing to them? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Les gustan.</span><br>Good. Les gustan. He likes them, or they are pleasing to him .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Le gustan.</span><br>Very good. So there are a couple of other verbs as well that we would prefer to give this kind of translation to. What do you think interesar means? Interesar .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Interesting.</span><br>Interesante is interesting. What does interesar look like? It might not be, but what does it look like? Interesar. What type of word does it look like? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>It's a verb.</span><br>Ah. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>So it's to interest.</span><br>Good. To interest. Good. So this helps us with comprehension as well, understanding what are our types of words and what they tend to look like. So we could translate it as to interest, or we could translate it as to be interesting to. And here in this case, it's another verb like gustar, in that it makes more sense to translate it for ourselves as to be interesting to, because it goes with le and not lo. So in our minds this fits then in the Spanish structure if we save that translation as to be interesting to rather than to interest. So how would you say it interests me, it is interesting to me? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Me interesa.</span><br>Good. Me interesa. Does it interest you? Let's speak informally. Does it interest you? .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>¿Le interesa bailar esta noche?</span><br>Good. ¿Le interesa bailar esta noche? Good. Salir, salir is to leave or to go out. To leave or to go out.

So let's go from the beginning, does it interest her? .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Salir a bailar esta noche.</span><br>Good. So here we have a because salir is a verb of coming and going. ¿Le interesa salir a bailar esta noche? Now what if you wanted to ask would it interest you, would it be interesting to you, informally? So what was our sound for would, that we add on to the 'to' form of the verb?

In the same way that if you take the word there and you get rid of the t and you replace it with w, you get where. Or if you take the word then and get rid of the t and replace it with w, you get when. So you have que for that, and then qué for what. Same word. So, it seems to me that .." ] ,

It seems to me that he doesn't like it. Now in English, this that is optional. No? It seems to me he doesn't like it. It seems to me that he doesn't like it. It's optional.

 [ " <span class='ans'>Me parece que no lo gusta. Le. No le gusta.</span><br>Good. You might want to say me parece bien. That would mean it seems good to me, it seems fine to me. But we're not using the word good, we're using the word well. Bien. Me parece bien. It seems to me well. You'll find a little gray area between English and Spanish about when we say good, bueno, and when we say well, bien. But it's something you'll pick up listening.

 [ " Track 46 <br> In English we have many ways to talk about the past. If you get any random verb like to eat, for example, you can say I ate. You can say I have eaten. You can say I was eating. You can say I used to eat. You can say I would eat an ice cream every week when I was a child, and there you use would to speak about the past in English. I would go to the cinema every day when I was young. So we have many different ways of talking about the past, but we can divide them into three. And in Spanish there are three. We have the I have eaten past, which is the one that we learnt already. I have eaten, with haber. And then the other two pasts we can think of as a line in the past and a dot in the past. So, what would fit into the line in the past is I was eating, I used to eat, I would eat all the time when I was younger, all of that is ongoing. It's like a line in the past. But then the dot in the past is I ate, finished. I ate, that's your dot in the past. Those are what we will consider our three different pasts, which all of the different ways of expressing the past in English fit into, and in Spanish we have these three forms. The one we learnt already is I have eaten, for example. First we need to manage the verb to have. What is the verb for to have in this context? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Haber.</span><br>Haber. Good. So we have haber, and we had a neat trick to find the different versions of haber, as we know it's very irregular. So what is I have? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>He.</span><br>Good. And we have .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Hemos.</span><br>Good. And what is he/she/it/you (formal) have or has? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Ha.</span><br>Good. And you, informally .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Has.</span><br>Good. And they have or you guys have .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Han.</span><br>So that's our panorama of haber. And then we need to find eaten. So, the version after haber, we want to think of it in this way, the version of the verb that comes after haber, rather than trying to translate eaten because the version of the verb that comes after have in English is often so different. I have wanted. I have been. Very different. But in Spanish, for –ar verbs we take off -ar and put -ado, and for –er/-ir verbs we take off the -er or -ir and we put -ido. So I have eaten .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>He comerido. Sorry, comido.</span><br>Good. You're taking off your ending and putting -ido. The only times we're adding onto the 'to' forms is with the futures, will and would. He comido. I have spoken .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>He hablado.</span><br>He hablado. Good. I have danced .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>He bailado.</span><br>Good. They have danced .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Han bailado.</span><br>Han bailado. The version that comes after haber: comido, bailado, doesn't change for I or for we or for they or for he or she. Always the same. We need to focus on haber to get the correct version of haber, and then we have the version of the verb that comes after it. So he bailado, han bailado, hemos bailado. We can also say more complicated things like I have been able to eat. What is to be able, related to power? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Poder.</span><br>Poder. Good. So I have been able, the version that comes after haber. Rather than translating been able, we just want poder after haber, so let's do that first. I have been able .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>He podido.</span><br>To eat .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Comer.</span><br>Good. He podido comer. I have been able to eat. I haven't been able to eat .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>No he podido comer.</span><br>Good. No he podido comer. So we can make more interesting structures as well, like this, using haber. We can also put haber in would time, which gives us the opportunity to make some useful structures. What is our sound for would? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>-ía.</span><br>So I would have from haber .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Habría.</span><br>Good. The /e/ fell out. Habría. What was to leave or to go out? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Salir.</span><br>Salir. So you can say I would have gone out. I would have gone out .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>He saliría?</span><br>So you've taken the sentence as a block to translate it all together, and then you have this kind of salad situation where this -ía's coming out in the wrong place. You must take the time to divide it up. I would have is your first bit, and you stop there. I would have, what's that? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Habería. Habría.</span><br>Habría. Good, and it's a very natural irregularity. You can imagine many years of saying habería, habería, habería, habería, habería, it happens very naturally for that e to fall out. It only happens with a few verbs, though. Habría. So I would have gone out .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Habría salido.</span><br>Habría salido. Good. I would have been able to go out. I would have been able to go out .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Habría podido salir.</span><br>Good. Habría podido salir. I wouldn't have been able to go out. I wouldn't have been able to go out .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>No habría podido salir.</span><br>Good. No habría podido salir. Good. So we have this haber that we can use for the past, but then also we can make some other very useful structures out of it, like would have, would have been able, etc. So now we're going to focus on another past in Spanish. We're going to focus now on the line in the past. So the line in the past representing I was eating, I used to eat, I would eat all the time, that would that we use for past. All of those are represented by this line in the past. Now, for the pasts – for both pasts, the line and the point – again we are taking off our verb ending before we add on our endings for the past. So we have a verb like hablar, for example, an –ar verb, and we will take off this -ar and we will put -aba, -aba, to get I/he/she/it/you (formal). So again, like in would time, we have I jumping in with he, she, it, and you (formal). So you have hablar, you take off the -ar and you put -aba .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Hablaba.</span><br>Hablaba. Hablaba. So hablaba means I was speaking, I used to speak, he was speaking, she was speaking, he used to speak, she used to speak, you were speaking, you used to speak, all of this in hablaba. Now you can probably make the other versions. How would you say you were speaking, speaking informally? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Hablabas.</span><br>Good. And they or you guys were speaking .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Hablaban.</span><br>Hablaban. And for the we version, the accent's going to stay in the same place on -aba. So how would you say we were speaking? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Hablábamos.</span><br>Hablábamos. Good. To wait is esperar. Esperar, to wait or to hope. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Esperar.</span><br>So how would you say I was waiting, I used to wait? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Esperaba.</span><br>Good. I was waiting for you, speaking informally? And we don't need the for, no? I was awaiting you .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Te esperaba.</span><br>Te esperaba. What if you were speaking formally? If you were speaking to usted and you wanted to say I was waiting for you .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Is it lo?</span><br>Yes. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Lo esperaba.</span><br>Or to a female, it would be? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>La esperaba.</span><br>Good. So lo and la other than it and he and she can also mean you (formal). We see those are always pairing together – he, she, it, and you (formal). Keeping it formal, speaking to usted, how would you say We were waiting for you? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Lo esperábamos.</span><br>Good. Lo esperábamos. Very good. And what if you wanted to say We were waiting for you guys? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Los esperábamos.</span><br>Los esperábamos. And of course, this could also mean We were waiting for them. Los esperábamos. To try, related to intent .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Intentar.</span><br>Good. Intentar. So how would you say I was trying? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Intentaba.</span><br>Good. Intentaba. He was trying .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Intentaba.</span><br>Good. What was to find, to encounter? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Encontrar.</span><br>Good. So how would you say They were trying to find it? They were trying to find it: so divide up the thoughts. They were trying, the first bit .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Intentaba? It's intentaban.</span><br>Good. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Encontrarlo.</span><br>Good. Intentaban encontrarlo. If you wanted to say They were trying to find it for me, the most natural way of saying this in Spanish is They were trying to find me it. They were trying to find me it .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Intentaban encontrármelo.</span><br>Intentaban encontrármelo. Good. They were trying to find me it. But if you wanted to emphasize They were trying to find me it, then you could say this sentence in the way that we would probably say it in English, which is They were trying to find it for me. Then you could do that in Spanish. You have that option. So how would you say that? They were trying to find it for me, using the word for .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Intentaban encontrarlo para mí.</span><br>Good. Intentaban encontrarlo para mí. So here we are emphasizing, actually me. But mostly in Spanish we kind of avoid the use of the preposition, as we've been noticing. Intentaban encontrármelo.<br>-- end of track --" ]

 [ " Track 47 <br> The dinner in Spanish is la cena, spelt c-e-n-a, la cena. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>La cena.</span><br>La cena. Those in Spain will pronounce /la thena/. So la cena, the dinner. Now, to dine, which doesn't sound formal in Spanish as it does in English, to dine, you just make la cena into a verb. <br>So how do you think that would sound? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Cenar.</span><br>Cenar. Good. So cenar is to dine. So how would you say I was dining, or more naturally in English, I was having dinner? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Cenaba.</span><br>Good. Cenaba. Now, apart from I was having dinner, what else can that mean? Cenaba? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>He/she/it were having dinner.</span><br>And? Who else? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>You (formal).</span><br>Good. So we have all of those meanings there with the -aba. So for this line in the past we have -aba for -ar verbs. We are taking off our -ar and we're putting -aba as our key sound, and then we are adding on more, so n or s. Quemar, q-u-e-m-a-r, quemar in Spanish is to burn. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Quemar.</span><br>Quemar. Good. How would you say He was burning the dinner? He was burning the dinner .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Quemaba la cena.</span><br>Good. Quemaba la cena. And if you wanted to show that it was he that was burning the dinner, how would you do that? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Just él. Él quemaba la cena.</span><br>Good. And if you wanted to show that it was you (formal), You were burning the dinner .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Usted quemaba la cena.</span><br>Good. Usted quemaba la cena. Good. So Él quemaba la cena, he was burning, and then we say what he was burning: the dinner. If we want to say The dinner was burning, The dinner was getting burnt, we can't just say La cena quemaba, because we are waiting to hear what was the dinner burning? It feels incomplete. So if you want to just say The dinner was burning, like The dinner was getting burnt, in Spanish we are going to say The dinner was burning itself. What is itself? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Se.</span><br>Se. So how would you say The dinner was burning, The dinner was getting burnt, The dinner was burning itself? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>La cena se quemaba.</span><br>Very good. That's it! La cena se quemaba. Good. The position of la cena is also flexible. You can say La cena se quemaba or you can put la cena afterwards. How would that be? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Se quemaba la cena.</span><br>Se quemaba la cena. So it's flexible, unlike in English, because in English, well we don't really change verbs so much. There are not so many grammatical resources in English as there are in Spanish, for example, so in English the word order is much more important than in Spanish to show what's going on. So we can say La cena se quemaba or Se quemaba la cena. Because we have se, we understand that the dinner was getting burnt, there was nobody else there involved. If you want to say I burn, like in the sun, in the sense of, you know, I get burnt, you're also going to use this structure, no? You're going to say I burn myself in the sun. Now you understand you're not burning yourself, it just means I get burnt. So sun is sol. In was .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Me quemo en el sol.</span><br>Good. Me quemo en el sol. You can't just say Quemo en el sol, because this would mean that I burn something in the sun, and we will be waiting to hear what you burn in the sun. Me quemo en el sol. If you want to say The sun burns me, this is another way you could put the sentence, and there we are not using this 'self' structure, because we have The sun burns and then we have me telling us what it burns, so it's complete. So how would you say that, the sun burns me? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>El sol me quema.</span><br>Good. El sol me quema. Me quema el sol. Either way. Another example of a verb like this is romper. Romper. Romper means – maybe you can guess it. What do you think romper means? <br>It's quite obscure, the connection, but you might find it. Rupture? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>To break.</span><br>To break. Romper, to break. So how would you say I break? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Rompo.</span><br>Rompo, with a p, rompo. I break it .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Lo rompo.</span><br>Lo rompo. Good. I break it. If you want to say it breaks, like it gets broken, it breaks all the time. All the time is todo el tiempo. Literally all, todo, el tiempo, the time. Todo, t-o-d-o, is all. So It breaks all the time, It breaks itself, it gets broken, all the time. How would you say that? It breaks all the time .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Se rompa todo –</span><br>The se got your attention, so you forgot to do something very important, which was to quickly go back to the 'to' form and be clear on what type of verb you're working with. .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>It's rompen. And, Se rompen todo el tiempo.</span><br>Se rompen todo el tiempo. They break themselves, not literally that they are breaking themselves, just they get broken. We don't have this get in Spanish, and this is how we get around it. What was tonight? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Esta noche.</span><br>Esta noche. So we said esta is this for feminine words. Esta noche. What was this for masculine words? How did we say this car? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Este auto.</span><br>Este auto. Este coche. Good. So este is this for masculine words. And we have the /e/ of el, like el auto, in este. Este auto. These cars are estos autos. So we go from este to estos for the plural. Not estes. Ah? Estos. Estos autos. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estos autos.</span><br>Now this might look irregular, but there is a logic there, it's just different to the one that we might expect. We have the /e/ of el in este, and we have the /os/ of los in estos. So we have the car .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Ese auto.</span><br>Ese auto. If estos coches or estos autos are these cars, how would you say those cars? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Esos autos.</span><br>Esos autos. Good. So how would you say those ones and for those ones you can just use this word for those and imagine me talking about masculine things or mixed things, things of mixed gender. Those ones break all the time, those ones break all the time .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Esos rompen todo el tiempo.</span><br>So now I'm waiting to hear what they break. Esos rompen todo el tiempo. .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Esos se rompen todo el tiempo.</span><br>Good. Esos se rompen todo el tiempo. So you will have to listen out in Spanish for these verbs that want you to show it when their action isn't to something else. It's transforming, not something else, se transforma. It breaks, it's breaking, not something else, se rompe. It's changing, not something else, but here you don't need it. Cambia, from cambiar. Cambia. Being aware that this occurs is enough, and we will listen out and in real life get a conscious understanding and also an intuition about where we need to do this.<br>-- end of track --" ]

The big difference of course is that for would we are adding on to the 'to' form of the verb and for the past we are taking off our endings first, which means we get pairs like comería, I would eat; comía, I was eating. Rompería, I would break; rompía, I was breaking. So how would you say it breaks, it breaks, and you mean it gets broken? It breaks itself in the present tense .." ] ,

The word for how in Spanish is cómo. If you want to ask somebody in Spanish, how do you say? - so maybe you have a Spanish speaking friend that speaks English. And you want to use them like a dictionary and say how do you say x, y, or z? What you will say in Spanish is how does it say itself? How is it said? How does it say itself? So this is another example of where you might be using this structure of self, which we are seeing in Spanish is very flexible. It's giving us many different meanings, this structure of myself, yourself, ourselves, itself, this structure. So it says from decir is dice. It's a little bit irregular, but then the other versions follow. So we have dice for he, she, it, or usted. <br>How would you say, you (informal) say? .." ] ,

If you want to say, how is it said, ¿Cómo se dice? How does it say itself? <br>So se is doing quite a lot in Spanish. Sometimes we are using it to wrap up the sentence, to show that we are not using a verb 'to' anybody or 'to' anything else like in it breaks, or it transforms, these examples that we saw. Sometimes the se is changing the meaning like between quedar, remain, or be leftover and quedarse, to stay. And sometimes this se has quite a creative application. Se vende. It sells itself, for sale. Or, we could even have se habla. Se habla español. Spanish speaks itself. Spanish is spoken. Spanish spoken. Se habla español. Quedar by itself means to remain. And you can use this in the sense of I have one left. In Spanish, you will say it remains to me one. This is the structure in Spanish. I have one left. It remains to me one.

No me quedan, no me queda, you will hear both just depending on what the person has in their mind. I have none left as in one. I have none left as in they've all gone. No me queda. No me quedan.

 [ " <span class='ans'>¿Cómo se llamaba?</span><br>Good. ¿Cómo se llamaba? What was her name, what was his name, or what was your name (formally)? What was their name, what were they calling themselves? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>¿Cómo se llamaban?</span><br>Good. ¿Cómo se llamaban? Good. What was to have, not in the sense of haber, not the have that we use to go into the past, but the have that we used for possession? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Tener. Good. And we said also that this tener is the -tain, -tain that we get inside various English verbs or Latin-English verbs like contain. Contain is contener. So we have this trick using tener that we can convert over some more verbs from English. So doing the same with obtain, we would get .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Obtener.</span><br>Obtener. Maintain changed a little bit. Have a go .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Mentener.</span><br>Mantener. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Mantener.</span><br>Mantener. And we said that man- actually is like from mano, hand. Sustain. And this one changed a little bit as well. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Sostener.</span><br>Sostener. So this -tain that we have in English is tener. To have. So how would you say I used to have? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Tenía.</span><br>Tenía. Good. So if you wanted to say I used to have a big house .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Tenía un grande casa. Un casa grande.</span><br>Yeah, almost, but un? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Una. Una casa grande.</span><br>Good. These bits and pieces require a little thought as well. Tenía una casa grande. We used to have a big house .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Teníamos una grande - una casa grande.</span><br>Good. Teníamos una casa grande. And the accent stays in the same place on the -ía. Tenía, teníamos. Good. I used to have four, but now I don't have any left. I used to have four, but now I don't have any left: the word for four is cuatro, cuatro. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Cuatro.</span><br>Related to .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Quarter.</span><br>Very good. So I used to have four .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Tenía cuatro.</span><br>Good. But now .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Pero ahora.</span><br>I don't have any left. So they don't remain me, or it doesn't remain to me. That's all we need to say to give that I don't have any left .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>No me queda.</span><br>Good. So all together. I used to have four, but now I don't have any left .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Tenía cuatro, pero ahora no me queda.</span><br>Good. Tenía cuatro, pero ahora no me queda or pero ahora, no me quedan. You could use either. So, we are not using have to give this meaning we have left. How was I have in the present? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Tengo.</span><br>Tengo. And how did you make that I have to? I have to in the sense of I must .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Que. Tengo que.</span><br>So I have to see you, and let's speak informally? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Tengo que verte.</span><br>Good. Tengo que verte. Now if you want to say I had to see you, you can use this line in the past that we learned even though in English we are saying had, not having to, this is fine in Spanish. So I had to see you, I was having to see you .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Tenía que verte.</span><br>Good. Tenía que verte. Good. Yesterday is ayer, a-y-e-r. Ayer. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Ayer.</span><br>Good. So I had to see you yesterday .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Tenía que verte ayer.</span><br>Good. Tenía que verte ayer. To do or to make was hacer. H-a-c-e-r. Hacer. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Hacer.</span><br>Did you have to do it yesterday? Talking informally, did you have to do it yesterday? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>¿Tenías que hacerlo ayer?</span><br>Good. ¿Tenías que hacerlo ayer? Didn't you have to do it yesterday? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>¿No tenías que hacerlo ayer?</span><br>Good. And you could use this like weren't you supposed to do it? ¿No tenías que hacerlo ayer? Didn't you have to do it yesterday? Weren't you supposed to do it yesterday? Good. I want to look at just three irregular verbs that we have for this line in the past. Now this is a very regular tense. There are very few irregularities in this tense. It's a very safe tense and the irregularities that we have are with very small verbs. For example, ver. How was I see, from ver? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Veo.</span><br>Veo. The same irregularity that we get in the I form in the present, veo; we get it in this line in the past. So instead of taking off -er and putting -o, we ended up with this extra e. So veía is I was seeing, I used to see, he was seeing, he used to see, she was seeing, she used to see, or you (formal). Veía. Give me the other versions then. We were seeing .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Veíamos.</span><br>Veíamos. They or you guys .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Veían.</span><br>Veían. You (informal) .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Veías.</span><br>Good. Another irregular verb in this tense is ser. Ser. To be. Now the base for I, he, she, it, you (formal) is era, era. Now this is very easy to remember because we are looking at the past which is a line in time and then era in English is a line in time in the past. So we can just think of an era. We would use this with characteristic things. So for example, if you wanted to say I used to be a student, what was student? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estudiante.</span><br>Good. So how would you say I used to be a student? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Era estudiante.</span><br>Era estudiante. Good. We don't need the word for a. Era estudiante. Good. Were you a student, informally? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>¿Eras estudiante?</span><br>Good. ¿Eras estudiante? We were students. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Eramos, eramos-</span><br>Where are you putting the accent? I couldn't tell. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>I put it at the -a, at the -AMos, but it's ERamos.</span><br>Éramos. Good. In these tenses the accent doesn't move around. Good, so era, éramos. Good. We were students .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Éramos estudiantes.</span><br>Good. What were they? What were they? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>¿Qué eran?</span><br>Yeah, ¿Qué eran? Good. And then the last one of course, that is irregular in this tense is ir. Ir. To go. Now I was going is kind of like a blend of the two different ways we have of creating this past: -aba and -ía. I was going is iba. So you see we get a bit of -ía and a bit of -aba with ir. I was going from to go. Iba. So you can give me the other versions. We were going .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Íbamos.</span><br>Good. They were going .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Iban.</span><br>Good. You were going, informally .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Ibas.</span><br>Ibas. Good. Why were you going? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>¿Por qué ibas?</span><br>Good. Now iba is very useful because, of course, you can use it like in the English I was going to call you, for example. I was going to go, but I didn't have the time. I was going to do it, but I forgot. So you can use it in this way as well, which is very common. So how would you say I was going to call you, and we are talking informally? I was going to call you .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Iba llamarte.</span><br>There is something missing. Iba llamarte. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Iba. I was. I was going.</span><br>Hmm, what kind of verb is going? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Iba a llamarte.</span><br>Good. Iba a llamarte. I was going to do it .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Iba hacerlo.</span><br>Good. And I'm not sure here if you are putting the a to connect the verbs. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>If I did it?</span><br>Yeah. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>No, I didn't. I forgot.</span><br>Ok, so again. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Iba a hacerlo.</span><br>Good. Iba a hacerlo. So actually in fluent speech you would hear /ibacerlo/. All of those three /a/'s, iba, a, hacer would blend together, so that's why I wasn't sure if you said it or not. We were going to do it or make it .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Íbamos a hacerlo.</span><br>Good. Íbamos a hacerlo. We were going to do them or we were going to make them .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Íbamos a hacerlos.</span><br>Good. Íbamos a hacerlos. Good.<br>-- end of track --" ]

[
 [ " Track 50 <br> Gracias por venir. Gracias por venir in Spanish means thanks for coming. Gracias por venir. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Gracias por venir.</span><br>So there's two things that we can see in this sentence. We can use this sentence like a hook to remember two important things about Spanish. The first thing is that we have two words for for. We already saw another word for for. For example, how were we saying for me? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Para mí.</span><br>Para mí. Good. And for you, speaking informally .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Para ti.</span><br>Para ti. So we had mí and ti coming with prepositions. Para mí, para ti, de mí, from me, de ti, from you, but then for the other people we just say for he, for example. So how is for him or for he in Spanish? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Para él.</span><br>Good. And for her .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Para ella.</span><br>Good. So this para is when something is for somebody. No? For example, if you want to say this is for you, speaking informally, let's say it's a masculine object. This, this one, is for you. How would you say that? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Ello-</span><br>What is tonight? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Ah, esta.</span><br>Good. So that's your hook and you go from there. Esta noche. But, I want a masculine thing. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Esto-</span><br>What you should do is look at somewhere that you've used it. So you should look at this car. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Este.</span><br>And then you find it. These are the processes that we're learning and this is half of the method. You can take yourself through those processes when you need to find it. Then it comes to your memory. Then you know it after that. But, the first few times, you need to have a look around, let's say, and seek to find it. So this or this one, masculine thing .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Este.</span><br>Este. So this one is for you (speaking informally) .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Este es para ti.</span><br>Good. Este es para ti if we mean a masculine thing. What if you meant these are for you (masculine or mixed things)? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estos son para ti.</span><br>Well done. Estos son para ti. So we saw that actually for this and these we have este and estos. In este we have the /e/ of el and in estos we have the /os/ of los. Estos son para ti. So this is the for that we learned until now, no? Then we have por which is much more flexible. It has many more meanings. Let's investigate some of them. Por. You can use it like because of. No? Sometimes when we say for in English, we mean because of. For example, if you say for this reason. What you mean is because of this reason. So you don't mean para, you mean por. So por also means for in the sense of because of. And actually in the words because and why, which were? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Por qué?</span><br>Por qué. Here in why, we see that it is because of. Por qué, why, actually means because of what. Because of what? And then porque as because. We said that we have the same word for why and because. Porque as because means because of that. So in both cases you have por, meaning because of. So reason in Spanish is razón. Razón. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Razón.</span><br>Or /rathón/ in most of Spain. /Rathón/. But in most of the Spanish speaking world /rasón/. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Razón.</span><br>Razón is feminine. So how would you say this reason? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Esta razón.</span><br>Good. So how would you say because of this reason, I don't want to go? Because of this reason, I don't want to go .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Por esta razón, no quiero ir.</span><br>Por esta razón, no quiero ir. Let's contrast the two. What was to buy? Do you remember to buy? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Comprer- comprer- comprar?</span><br>Comprar. Good. Comprar. You can say I'm buying it for you. How would you say that? Let's keep it informal. I'm buying it for you .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Lo compro para ti.</span><br>Good. Lo compro para ti. That means, you know, this thing I'm buying it for you. But maybe, in some contexts you want to say I'm buying it because of you. How would you say that? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Lo compro por ti.</span><br>Good. Lo compro por ti. So it doesn't mean necessarily that this thing is for that person, just that you've bought it because of that person. So maybe you buy an ashtray in your house and your one friend that smokes comes and you say lo he comprado por ti. I have bought it because of you. If you say lo he comprado para ti, for you, then he'll run to take the ashtray home. Another use for por is when we're talking about time. When you are talking about periods of time, for two weeks, for two days, you will not say para. You will say por. This is another place where you use por. The word for day is día. Día. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Día.</span><br>Día. It's actually related to an Indo-European root which just means a very old root meaning light. And deity in English comes from the same root. Or the ju- of Jupiter is actually also from this root. Jupiter means something like the father of the gods. You have -piter like paternal there and ju- from this same root as día and deity. And of course you have Jupiter which is the biggest planet, so the father of the gods, Jupiter. <br>Día is a word that looks feminine and it's one of those few words that end in -a, that look feminine, but are masculine. So the day is .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>El día.</span><br>El día. And the days .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Los días.</span><br>Los días. And every day is all the days. Before we said todo el tiempo to say all the time. If you want to say every day, you say all the days. How do you think that would sound? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Todos los días.</span><br>Good. Todos in plural. Todos los días. Good. If you wanted to say I'm staying for three days, three is tres. Tres. I'm staying for three days, I remain myself for three days, so how would you say that? I'm staying for three days .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Me quedo por tres días.</span><br>Very good. Me quedo por tres días. I'm staying for three days. How would you say I will stay for three days, I will stay for three days. You don't really need- you don't need the will here. The fact that you say for three days is already some kind of a future context. The days didn't happen yet, but let's practice the future. So I will stay for three days .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>So it's quedé?</span><br>In both futures, we are adding on to the verb- .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Quedaré.</span><br>Yes, we are pushing it into the future. So I will stay for three days .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Me quedaré por tres días.</span><br>Good. Me quedaré por tres días. So this sounds a little bit more certain, you know, when you use the future. Me quedo por tres días. I'm staying for three days. Me quedaré por tres días. I will stay for three days. How would you say I would stay for three days? I would stay for three days. A nice hook to remember would is I would like or it would please me. This is a nice hook. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Me gustaría.</span><br>So this is a nice hook to remember would, because it is something that is very common that you will use a lot. So what is that little bit you need for would that you can pluck out of me gustaría? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>The -ía ending.</span><br>Perfect. So I would stay for three days .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Me quedaría por tres días.</span><br>Good. Me quedaría por tres días. But, I have to work. Do you remember what is to work? We saw it very briefly? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Trabajar.</span><br>Trabajar. Good. Trabajar is t-r-a-b-a-j-a-r and that -jar makes /har/. Trabajar. So, but I have to work .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Pero tengo que trabajar.</span><br>Yes, now all together. I would stay for three days, but I have to work. And not from memory, but thinking it through. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>I know because I've already forgotten it.</span><br>Good. So, thinking it through again. Taking that time to think it through again. I would stay is the first bit .." ] ,

 [ " Track 51 <br> What was I am, from estar? I am .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estoy.</span><br>Estoy. If you want to say I'm there for you, I'm there for you, you know, in this supportive way, you don't have to say there to begin with. Because we are using estar and not ser, it kind of makes that there a little redundant. We feel that already in estar that's referring to states, locations and states, so we don't need to say there. We can just say I'm for you, I'm for you, using estar. What for do you think you need? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Para.</span><br>Good. So how would you say I'm there for you, talking to a friend? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estoy para ti.</span><br>Estoy para ti. Good. To say I'm here because of you, then we are not going to use para. We don't even really need to say here. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>If it's still estoy it still implies location.</span><br>It kind of just gives you the feeling. Actually, when you knock on somebody's door and you are calling for them, you will just say ¿Estás? You don't say Are you there? Or if you're on internet, ¿Estás? you will write in the messenger. If you call somebody up and you want to speak to Juan, you will not say Is Juan there? You will just say ¿Está Juan? ¿Juan está? So, I am here because of you (formal) .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estoy por usted.</span><br>Good. Estoy por usted. For you (informal) .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estoy por ti.</span><br>Estoy por ti. So this would be because of you. How would you say I have come because of you, I have come because of you (informal). I have come because of you .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Ah, the first bit is he. He venido por ti.</span><br>He venido por ti. So whenever we want because of, we want to avoid the temptation to translate porque de, because of. Good. So I have come because of you, he venido por ti. You could also say It is because of you that we have come, for example. It is because of you that we have come. And of course we can make this sentence perfectly if we think it through piece by piece. So, it is because of you .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Es por ti.</span><br>That we have come .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Que hemos venido.</span><br>Good. Es por ti que hemos venido. It is because of you that we have come. Good. Another use of por – so we are seeing that por is much more flexible than para – another use of por is if you want to say for in the sense of exchanging this one for that one, to exchange something for something else, then also we use por. Cambiar, cambiar, means to change. If you want to say, I would change this one for that one, I would change this one for that one, and with this one and that one let's refer to a masculine thing. So, I would change is the first step. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Cambiaría?</span><br>Uh-huh. This one, a masculine thing .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Este.</span><br>Good. For that one, masculine thing. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Por ese.</span><br>Good. Take away the t. Good. Cambiaría este por ese. I would change this one for that one. How would you say I would change these ones for those ones, masculine or mixed objects? I would change these ones for those ones .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Cambiaría estos por esos.</span><br>Good. Cambiaría estos por esos. Very good. What if they were feminine things? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Cambiaría estas por esas.</span><br>Good. Cambiaría estas por esas. Good. Would you change these ones for those ones? Speaking informally. Would you change these ones for those ones?, still feminine things .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>¿Cambiarías estas por esas?</span><br>Good. ¿Cambiarías estas por esas? Wouldn't you change these ones for those ones?, still feminine .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>¿No cambiarías estas por esas?</span><br>Good. Go on .. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>¿Por qué no cambiaría estas por esas?</span><br>Still think it through though. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Sorry, ¿Por qué no cambiarías estas por esas?</span><br>Good. We don't want to stop thinking. You will be able to relax that as you go on, but at the beginning you want to be very insistent on your thinking so you install correct structural habits or grammatical habits. We don't really use much grammatical terminology, but everything we're seeing here is grammar, of course. It's all structure. Ah, something I should mention is that if you're chatting online, if you're practicing your Spanish online you might see por written as an x as a shortcut. Because por is also what you use in, like, times tables. Ocho por ocho is eight times eight. So you might see gracias por venir as gracias x venir. And if you have the habit of writing kisses with an x this can be very confusing to Spanish speakers. So gracias por venir reminds us, this nice hook, that we will hear a lot, gracias por venir, reminds us that we have two words for for. Para, something being for you, quite literally, and then por, which is much more flexible in meaning. The other thing that we learn from the sentence gracias por venir is that after prepositions, so these little group of words, we've seen - para, por, de, en, con, a, we've seen quite a few of them - following these words in English we put -ing. Thank you for coming. But in Spanish we just put the 'to' form. Gracias por venir. So how would you say thank you for calling, thank you for calling - if you forget call you can think of what's your name? or how are you called? because it's something that people tend to have heard somewhere. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Gracias por llamar.</span><br>Good. Gracias por llamar. And if you wanted to say thanks for calling me you could say that as well. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Gracias por llamarme.</span><br>Good. Gracias por llamarme. So after prepositions we don't use the -ing. We want to resist any temptation to put the -ing form after the preposition. This is negative language transfer, things that are not the same between English and Spanish. What was I am from estar? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estoy.</span><br>Estoy. And you remember how to say tired in Spanish? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Cansado.</span><br>Good. Cansado. So how do you say I am tired? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estoy cansado.</span><br>But you being a female? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Cansada.</span><br>Good. Estoy cansada. So if you want to say I'm tired of – dancing, cooking, cleaning – it's all going to be with the 'to' form. What was to work? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Trabajar.</span><br>Trabajar. How would you say I'm tired of working? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estoy cansada de trabajar.</span><br>Yes. Estoy cansada de trabajar. Good. For one of the pasts that we saw, for the line in the past, so when we're referring to like a period of time in the past, for –ar verbs we have the -aba base ending. So how would you say I was from estar? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estaba.</span><br>Estaba. I was tired of working .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estaba cansada de trabajar.</span><br>Estaba cansada de trabajar. Good. I was tired of working. Good. We were tired of working, and let's be a masculine or a mixed group. We were tired of working .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estábamos cansados de trabajar.</span><br>Very good. Estábamos cansados de trabajar. Good. If you want to say something like it's a way of doing it, it's a way of doing it, the word for way is form, a form of doing it, and how do you think form might be in Spanish if you had to guess it? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Forma.</span><br>Yes. Forma. Good. So how would you say a way of doing it? What was to do or to make? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Hacer.</span><br>It is a way of doing it .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Es una forma de hacerlo.</span><br>Good. Es una forma de hacerlo. Good. I don't believe in arguing like this, in this way. I don't believe in arguing in this way. So, to believe is creer, creer and it has two e's, c-r-e-e-r, creer. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Creer.</span><br>So how do you say I don't believe? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>No creo.</span><br>No creo. What was creation? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Creación.</span><br>And what was to create? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Crear.</span><br>And what was I create? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Creo.</span><br>Yes. So we get this situation occasionally in Spanish that the 'I' form of two different verbs will look the same. Creo, of course, could be from creer, to believe, or from crear, to create. So, I don't believe .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>No creo.</span><br>In arguing. So to argue in Spanish you can use to discuss. This is the most common verb, actually, that's used for argue. Discuss is discutir, discutir. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>So what do they use for discuss?</span><br>Hablar, mostly, but you can use discutir as well for discuss, but it has a heavy connotation mostly. No? I mean, if you argue with your boyfriend or your girlfriend you use discutir, you say this. Argüir, which is argue, means to argue a point, rather than to get in an argument. Discutir is more like to get in an argument. So it's what we can call a false friend, words that look like they are the same, but they have a difference in meaning, and there are a few of them. We need to watch out for them between English and Spanish. Another example would be actual, which doesn't mean actual, it means current, no? Mi trabajo actual, my current job. Actualmente means currently, at the moment, rather than actually. Mostly the vocabulary, the Latin English that we turn into Spanish, is very reliable, but there are a few words that we want to watch out for. Discutir is one of them. This doesn't really mean to discuss as much as it does to argue. So, I don't believe in arguing .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>No creo en discutir.</span><br>Good. In this way, we will say of this way rather than in this way. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>De esta forma.</span><br>Good. So all together, I don't believe in arguing, in discussing, in this way .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>No creo en discutir de esta forma.</span><br>Good. No creo en discutir de esta forma. Good. So with this sentence, gracias por venir, we are reminded how we have two words for for, por and para, and we need to have a think and decide which one we think is most appropriate before we translate for. And that after prepositions we don't need to worry about making the -ing form of the verb, we just use the 'to' form.<br>-- end of track --" ]

[
 [ " Track 52 <br> Para, this for, para, can also mean in order to, in order to. So in a sentence, for example, We have spoken in order to resolve it. We have spoken in order to resolve it. Now in English we could just say We have spoken to resolve it, no? We don't need to say in order to. But whenever we have this to meaning in order to, we want to translate this as para in Spanish. So let's make this sentence. First bit is We have spoken. We have spoken .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Hemos hablado.</span><br>Hemos hablado. To resolve it – in order to resolve it. Now, to resolve is resolver. Ah? The same word, resolver. So We have spoken in order to resolve it .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Hemos hablado para resolverlo.</span><br>Good. Hemos hablado para resolverlo. Good. So whilst the to of to resolve, resolver, would fit nicely here, I mean if we were to translate directly from English, We have spoken to resolve it, it doesn't work in Spanish. Whenever this to means in order to, we must put that para. Hemos hablado para resolverlo. You could say We have spoken in order to try to resolve it. What was to try? Related to intention .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Intentar.</span><br>Good. We have spoken in order to try to resolve it .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Hemos hablado para intentar resolvar– resolverlo.</span><br>Good. Hemos hablado para intentar resolverlo. So only when the to implies in order to we want to put para. The 'to' form of the verb in Spanish is not enough to include that meaning. We must put para. So for example, if you want to say I'm here to see you, does it mean I'm here in order to see you? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Yes.</span><br>Good. So I am here to see you (informally) .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estoy aquí para verte.</span><br>Good. Estoy aquí para verte. This is also something we could learn or interiorize through the negative language transfer that some Spanish speakers make when they speak English. For example, you might hear a Spanish speaker say I am here for see you or for seeing you. You might hear a Spanish speaker, especially with basic English, making this mistake. Now once you've heard that a few times, you would say, 'Oh, maybe this is how you say it in Spanish.' So we don't want to forget this opportunity, the opportunity to learn from the negative language transfer, the mistakes that Spanish speakers make in English, which originate from Spanish. Once you hear the same mistake a few times, you can assume it probably comes from Spanish. I have called you in order to speak about it: so the first bit is I have called you, I have phoned, I have called (informally) .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>He llamado. Ah, sorry. Te he llamado.</span><br>In order to speak about it .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Para hablarlo.</span><br>Good. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>We don't use about.</span><br>No. Good. Te he llamado para hablarlo. So if we take the sentence in English, I have called you to speak about it, and we translate it directly, then we will say Te he llamado hablarlo. But when our to means in order to, we must put this para. Te he llamado para hablarlo. I have called you in order to speak about it. Good. What was to be, for states? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estar.</span><br>Estar. And we said that we can use this to express when we are doing something right now. We can say, instead of I eat, como, I am eating, using this structure with estar and then the -ing form of the verb. Do you remember how you would get the -ing form of comer, for example? Of –er or –ir verbs? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Comiendo?</span><br>Comiendo. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Comiendo.</span><br>Good. Comiendo. So we add on -iendo for –er/-ir verbs and for –ar verbs we add on? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>-ando.</span><br>Good. So how would you say I am eating? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estoy comiendo.</span><br>Estoy comiendo. And this means right now, no? I am speaking .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estoy hablando.</span><br>Estoy hablando. I am explaining it: to explain – we would go from explanation but explanation is an exception. It's not 'explanación' in Spanish as we might hope, it's explicación. And we see we even have that /k/ sound in explain, explicación, we have it in English as well in inexplicable, for example we say in English. Inexplicable in Spanish. So we can see where that sound's coming from. So how is explanation or explication in Spanish? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Explicación.</span><br>Good. And to explain .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Explicar.</span><br>Explicar. Good. So I'm explaining it and you mean right now? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estoy explicándolo.</span><br>Estoy explicándolo. Lo estoy explicando. The lo can go on the end of a 'to' form, but it can also go on the end of one of these -ando or -iendo forms as well. So you have the option. Lo estoy explicando. Estoy explicándolo. And you mean right now. Actually in explicar, we get this -plicar from 'plicare' that we mentioned before, meaning to fold in Latin. So explicar, to explain, to unfold. You might want to say I'm taking a Spanish course. Even if you're not in the course right now in this moment, when we are taking a course, in our minds there's a period of time in which we are taking a course and when we say it we're in that period of time. If I say I'm taking a Spanish course, maybe I mean for three months and I'm in that period. Do you remember what to take was? We used it with to take a photo. Tomar. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Tomar.</span><br>Tomar. So tomar is to take. So I am taking .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estoy tomando.</span><br>Good. Estoy tomando. A course: I'm going to let you guess it. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Una corsa?</span><br>Close. It's not with a, it's with o. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Un corso.</span><br>Un curso, with a u. Un curso. Good. Of Spanish, this is how you would say a Spanish course, a course of Spanish. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Un curso de español.</span><br>Very good. Estoy tomando un curso de español. Good. Now, what if we put this estoy in the past tense that we learnt? The past tense that is -aba or -ía. I was taking a Spanish course .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estar, estaba.</span><br>Good. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estaba tomando un curso de español.</span><br>Good. Estaba tomando un curso de español. Which means we actually have two ways of saying I was taking. We can say estaba tomando or we can just use tomar and use that line in the past. How would that sound? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Tomaba.</span><br>Yes. So both tomaba and estaba tomando mean I was taking. So you have that option. Estaba tomando un curso de español or tomaba un curso de español. What was to eat? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Comer.</span><br>Comer. How would you say I was eating? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Comía.</span><br>Comía. Or? How else could you say it? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estaba comiendo.</span><br>So you have this option. Comía or estaba comiendo. Most of the time they're interchangeable, sometimes one might fit slightly better than the other and it's something you will pick up very naturally when you're practicing. So if in one situation people tend to use estaba comiendo rather than comía, you will pick it up. So we have -ando and -iendo to form this -ing. And we saw in Spanish that we don't use it after prepositions. You don't use this -ing either if you say something like swimming is healthy or running is healthy. You don't use the -ing there either. You will just say to run is healthy, to swim is healthy. If you hear people toast in Spanish you might hear them say salud, which means health. Healthy is saludable. To dance is healthy .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Bailar es saludable.</span><br>Good. Bailar es saludable. Good. To swim is nadar. Nadar. To swim is healthy .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Nadar es saludable.</span><br>Nadar es saludable. So we're seeing that we don't use the -ing in Spanish as much as we do in English. Sometimes in English we make an adjective with -ing. We go from to interest to interesting. When we do this in English, this -ing that we use in English to form an adjective, in Spanish it's -ante for –ar verbs and -iente for –er/-ir verbs. So for example, we have to interest, what was to interest? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Interesar.</span><br>Good. Interesar. So if you get rid of -ar and you put -ante, you get that -ing adjective, interesting. So how would you say interesting? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Interesante.</span><br>Interesante. Good. So when you make an adjective with -ing in English from the verb, you can just replace it with -ante or -iente. How would you say to irritate in Spanish? And you can go from irritation .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Irritación. Irritar.</span><br>Irritar. So if you want to say irritating .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Irritante.</span><br>Irritante. It is irritating .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Es irritante.</span><br>Good. Es irritante. Good. How would you say to frustrate in Spanish? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Ah, frustration. Frustación. Frustar.</span><br>Frustrar. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Frustrar.</span><br>Yes, because you have the two r's, no? Frustrate. Frustrate, Frustrar. Frustrating .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Frustrante.</span><br>Frustrante. Good. To wane, to wane, to reduce in size, in Spanish this is menguar. Menguar. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Menguar.</span><br>When the moon gets smaller, it's waning. And the moon is la luna. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>La luna.</span><br>La luna. So how would you say the waning moon? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>La luna menguante.</span><br>Good. So there we're making waning like an adjective, not like the verb, not menguando. Ah? Menguante, la luna menguante. Luna is an interesting word. I don't know if you ever noticed, like, in English Monday is 'moon day'. It's not very obvious in English that the days of the week relate back to the planets. But in Spanish it's very obvious. You have la luna, the moon, and then you have lunes, Monday. Tuesday is martes. And Mars is marte, planeta marte. Wednesday in Spanish is miércoles. What planet does that sound like? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Mercury.</span><br>Yes. Jueves in Spanish is spelt with a j .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Jupiter.</span><br>Jupiter. Viernes is Friday .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Venus.</span><br>Venus. So you can see much clearer there how our days of the week are named after planets. To live was vivir. V-i-v-i-r. So vivir is to live. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Vivir.</span><br>Good. We have two 'to be's, we have estar for states, and for characteristics we have? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Ser.</span><br>Ser. And we said that un ser, un ser, means a being, that we can use ser like a noun and we get a being. So a human being is? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Un ser humano.</span><br>Un ser humano. You could also say a living being, a living being .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Un ser vivir.</span><br>How do you get this – .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Vivo.</span><br>You could say un ser vivo. Vivo is also like an adjective, which means alive. But living is adjective that we make with -ing. We can build it from vivir. For –ar verbs we have -ante and for –er/-ir verbs we have -iente. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Un ser viviente.</span><br>Good. Un ser viviente. A living being. What was to go out or to leave? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Voy?</span><br>To go out or to leave. So it's 'to'. I don't care if it's wrong, but I want it to end in r. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Ah, salir. Salir.</span><br>Salir. Now we have in English, you might have heard, salient, which means kind of protruding or outstanding, or something that stands out or sticks out or protrudes. This is a Latin-English version of this -ante/-iente rule. So we can see it even in English. <br>How would salient be in Spanish? You can go from salient or you can go from salir. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Saliente.</span><br>Saliente. Good.<br>-- end of track --" ]
] ,
[
 [ " Track 53 <br> What was to be able, can, in the 'to' form? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Poder.</span><br>Poder. So we have poder. If we want to make could, we have two different could's. We have the could that refers to the past, I couldn't do it yesterday. And we have a could that refers to the future: but I could do it tomorrow. This future could - we learned it already from to be able, would be able: poder, 'podería' and the e fell out podría. If we want to say I could in the past, most of the time we will probably find ourselves using this line past that we learned. The past that we make with -aba for -ar verbs and -ía for -er/-ir verbs. So how would you say I could, referring to past? I could, I was able to .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Podía.</span><br>Podía. So this is I was able to, I could. The past could, podía. We could .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Podíamos.</span><br>Good. I couldn't do it because I didn't have the time. For both of these we can use that line in the past, that ongoing past, even though we're not using it in English. I couldn't do it because I didn't have the time. So the first bit is I couldn't do it .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>No podía hacerlo.</span><br>Good. No podía hacerlo. Because .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Porque.</span><br>I didn't have the time .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>No tenía el tiempo.</span><br>Good. No podía hacerlo porque no tenía el tiempo. So we're going to contrast much more how we use this line and this dot in the past when we look at that dot. So what we're seeing for now - even though we haven't looked at the dot yet - that the decisions that we need to make in Spanish about whether we will use this line in the past, this ongoing past, or this dot, this point in the past, is a decision based on context rather than identifying which one we're using in English and then translating it. So we can begin to look at that even before we've learned the dot in the past. <br>The word for yesterday was ayer. Ayer. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Ayer.</span><br>Good. So how would you say, I couldn't do it yesterday? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>No podía hacerlo ayer.</span><br>Good. No podía hacerlo ayer. And when we learn the dot form of the past, we will see that we could have used that one as well. Sometimes they're interchangeable. Sometimes this dot and this line form are not interchangeable. For example, if we want to use haber to say I had eaten rather than I have eaten, I had gone already, rather than I have gone, then we always use the line in the past. Always. So from haber, how do you say I had? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Había.</span><br>Había, good. So if you want to say I had eaten, how would you say it? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Would you say, 'había comer'?</span><br>You have a version of the verb that comes after haber, no matter what version of haber we have, había, habría, he, it doesn't matter. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Comido. Había comido.</span><br>Good. Había comido. The word for already in Spanish is ya. Y-a. Ya. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Ya.</span><br>And it tends to go at the beginning. That would be the least emphatic place, the most natural place. So how would you say I had eaten already? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Ya había comido.</span><br>Good. Ya había comido. So you could say, he wanted to dine with me, but I had dined already. So, he wanted, what is to want? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Querer.</span><br>Querer. So, he wanted. Again we're using the line in the past, because even though in English there we are using the dot - we're not saying he was wanting, he used to want - with querer we can use the line without any problem because most of the time, when you want something, it's not just for an instant, it's kind of an ongoing feeling. The dinner was la cena. What was to dine, or to have dinner? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Cenar?</span><br>Yes. He wanted to dine with me .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Quería cenar con mí?</span><br>And this was a bit of an exception. You do not say 'con mí', you say .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Ah, conmigo.</span><br>Good. Quería cenar conmigo, but I had already had dinner. I had dined already .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Pero ya había cenado.</span><br>Good. But if you say, quería cenar conmigo, pero ya había cenado, I might understand he wanted to dine with me, but he had dined already, no? Because we have the same verb form, so how would we make that clearer? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Just saying yo at some point.</span><br>Exactly. But where? So give it to me again, and we can say the word for he as well, especially when we are contrasting between two people, we will have the habit of putting who. So, he wanted to dine with me, but I had dined already .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Él quería cenar conmigo pero yo ya había .. so dined, cenaría, no.</span><br>No. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Cenía.</span><br>What you want to translate is not dined. You want to find the version after haber. This is going to save you a lot of pain. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Cenado.</span><br>Good. He wanted to have dinner with me but I had already had dinner. Él quería cenar conmigo pero yo ya había cenado. Now we don't need to look at or discuss when we use had as opposed to when we use have, when we use I had lost it as opposed to I have lost it, because it's exactly the same in Spanish as it is in English. So you will just translate the thought, let's say. For example, you might want to say, he was looking for it because I had lost it. He was looking for it because I had lost it. To look for is buscar, buscar, to look for. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Buscar.</span><br>Good. Buscar, to look for. So, he was looking for it, he was searching for it .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Buscía.</span><br>Check the ending first. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Buscaba.</span><br>Good. He was looking for it .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Lo buscaba.</span><br>To lose was? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Perder.</span><br>Because I had lost it .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Porque yo lo había perdido.</span><br>Good. Lo buscaba, or él lo buscaba, porque yo lo había perdido. Good. How would you say, I would have lost it - so not I had lost it, I would have lost it? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Lo habería perdido.</span><br>Good. I would have lost it. Lo habría perdido. Now I'm not sure if you said habría or 'habería' because this irregularity that we have which is habría happens so naturally because that e kind of falls out so naturally. I think you said 'habería', but you kind of didn't pronounce the e well. Is that right? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>I meant to say 'habería'.</span><br>Yes. So you see that naturally it's happening, that e of haber is falling away, and that has been formalised in Spanish. You write it like this, h-a-b-r-i-a. Habría. Only with a few verbs, this contraction is occurring. Habría. Lo habría perdido. I would have lost it. How would you say, I would have got lost, or I would have lost myself? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Me habría perdido.</span><br>Good. Me habría perdido. Good.<br>-- end of track --" ]
] ,
[
 [ " Track 54 <br> Now, these versions of the verb that we get after haber, and we said that it's any version of haber, whether it's he, whether it's había, whether it's habría, we could even say I will have. I will have lost it – lo habré perdido. Any version of haber - we will have the -ado, -ido version after it, even if it's in the 'to' form – we could say something like I would like to have gone. I would like to have gone. I would like, it would please me .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Me gustaría.</span><br>To have gone. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Haber ido.</span><br>Me gustaría haber ido, it would please me to have gone, I would like to have gone, me gustaría haber ido. So, even after the 'to' form we're having just one version of the verb that can come after haber. Now, this version of the verb that can come after haber is very useful, because, if it makes sense, we can use it as an adjective, just as we can in English. For example, in English we say: I have sold. And sold we can use like an adjective, we can say it is sold. We say I have lost. And we can use it like an adjective – I am lost. And you can do the same in Spanish, which gives you hundreds and hundreds of words now that you can access as adjectives. So, for example, to close is cerrar. Cerrar. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Cerrar.</span><br>How would you say: I have closed it? I have closed it .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Lo he cerrado.</span><br>Good. Lo he cerrado. You might be referring to the door, which is la puerta. So, if you were referring to the door, how would you say that? I have closed it .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>La he cerrado.</span><br>Good. La he cerrado. Good. So cerrado – we can take that and we can use it as an adjective. Now, it doesn't change ever after haber – it's always cerrado: lo he cerrado, la he cerrado, lo hemos cerrado. But, when it's an adjective, when it's behaving like an adjective, then of course, it can change. <br>So, if you say it is closed and you mean the door, how would you say it? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Cerrada.</span><br>Good, so how would you say that, it is closed? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Es cerrada.</span><br>You think to be closed is a state or a characteristic? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Está cerrada.</span><br>Está cerrada. In fact, the great majority, with just a couple of exceptions, of these adjectives that we get from -ado, -ido, that we get from the version that comes after haber, go with estar. With this particular type of adjective we don't need to really think about whether it's a state or a characteristic, they are just gonna go with estar, with a couple of exceptions. To lose was .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Perder.</span><br>What is the version that comes after haber, after any form of haber? Perder becomes .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Perdido.</span><br>Perdido. So, how would you say: I am lost? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estoy perdido, or female, perdida.</span><br>Good. Estoy perdido, or for feminine, perdida. Good. What was to finish or to terminate? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Terminar.</span><br>Terminar. How would you say: I have finished? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>He terminado.</span><br>Good. He terminado. So now you can also say it is finished, and use it like an adjective. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Está terminado.</span><br>Good. Está terminado. What if you were referring to the movie, which is la película .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Está terminada.</span><br>Good. Está terminada. Good. So, this gives us a lot of adjectives we can access. Let's have a look at some of them. To sell was vender, and then sold would be .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Vendido.</span><br>Good. They are sold .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Están vendidos.</span><br>Están vendidos. And if we mean las casas, how will it sound? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Están vendidas.</span><br>Good. Están vendidas. Good. Some of the adjectives that we already met are actually adjectives that were formed in this way. How was the word for tired? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Cansado.</span><br>Cansado. And this comes from the verb cansar, to tire. So cansar is to tire, and then cansado is the version that you get after haber, and it's the adjective, cansado, tired. So, if you want to say I get tired, I tire myself, so now it's present .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Me canso.</span><br>Me canso. That means I get tired or even I get fed up. How would you say I have tired myself? And like I said, it doesn't literally mean that you are responsible for tiring yourself, it just means that you've got tired or you can use it like 'I've had enough'. So, I have tired myself .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>He- Me he cansado.</span><br>Good. Me he cansado. I've gotten tired, I've gotten fed up. Good. And then cansado - which is the version of cansar after haber - is also, of course, the adjective tired. I am tired .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estoy cansada.</span><br>Good. So, to close is cerrar, and we said that closed is cerrado. And we said that these –ado, -ido adjectives, with a couple of exceptions, go with estar. So, how would you say it is closed? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Está cerrado.</span><br>Good. How would you say he is closed to the idea - idea is the same word in Spanish. He is closed to the idea .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Está cerrado a el idea?</span><br>What gender does it look like: idea? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>La idea.</span><br>Está cerrado a la idea. He is closed to the idea. But if you want to say he is a closed person, you mean as a person he is closed, how do you think you would say it? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Es un person cerrado?</span><br>Almost. This is exactly the structure that we want, well done. But, the word for person is feminine, it doesn't refer to anybody specifically, just the word itself is feminine. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Es una persona cerrado- cerrada.</span><br>Good. Cerrada refers to person. Very good. Es una persona cerrada. So that's how we can get around that, if we want to say he is closed and we mean he is a closed person. If we just say es cerrado it sounds like a mistake. But es una persona cerrada is fine, because es is going with persona, what you are saying essentially is he is a person that is closed. Es una persona cerrada. <br>How would you say she is lost? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Está perdida.</span><br>Good. Está perdida, she is lost. But if you want to say She is lost, you know, as a person, she's lost her way .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Es una persona perdida. Well, actually, why not está here?</span><br>In this structure you are saying she is a person, you are not looking at lost person, you are looking at person. The adjective is totally secondary. So when you say this is a chair you are going to use ser. If you are going to say it's a wet chair, even thought that is a state, you are still going to use ser. Because what you are saying is it's a chair, the adjective is secondary. But, if you say it is wet, then you use estar. So, chair or seat is silla. Silla. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Silla.</span><br>Good. Mojar, mojar means to wet. Mojar. Now, how do you think you say wet as an adjective? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Mojada.</span><br>Good. For silla, mojada. Feminine. Good. So, how would you say the chair, la silla, the chair is wet? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>La silla está mojada.</span><br>Good. La silla está mojada. But, if you say it is a wet chair, you are just saying it is a chair, and then an adjective is secondary, and the fact that it is a chair is about as characteristic as it gets.

The structure there is it is a chair, the adjective is secondary. But, when we say the chair is wet, then we are talking about a state of the chair with is: la silla está mojada.

 [ " <span class='ans'>He cancelado.</span><br>Good. He cancelado. And we said that the version of the verb that you get after haber – you can use it like an adjective as well in Spanish, just as we do in English. For example in English we could say it's cancelled. We use the same version, cancelled, that comes after haber. So we can do the same in Spanish. So, how would you say it is cancelled, and I remind you that the adjectives that we form in this way tend to go with estar, only with a few exceptions that are more flexible. So it is cancelled .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Está cancelado.</span><br>Está cancelado. What if we meant la fiesta, the party? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Está cancelada.</span><br>Good. Está cancelada. Fiesta, by the way is actually related to festival, festivity, we can see the e splitting between festival and fiesta. To complicate in Spanish, what's complication? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Complicación, complicar.</span><br>Complicar, 'with folding', complicar. Good. If you want to say it has got complicated, it has got complicated, how do you think you will say it? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Se ha complicado.</span><br>Good. Se ha complicado. It has got complicated. It has complicated itself, we would say. Very good. So, the adjective complicated is .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Complicado.</span><br>Complicado. Good. So, you can say: It is complicated .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Es complicado.</span><br>Es complicado. Or? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Está complicado.</span><br>Está complicado. Actually, with this one you can use either; there tends to be a tendency to go with estar with these types of adjectives, but with complicado you could say either. Es complicado, está complicado, depending on what you were talking about, you might feel more drawn to one or to the other, but most of the time they are going to be interchangeable here. We can also make structures like should have, could have with this haber. Let's start with should have. Now should, we take it from the verb to owe, which also we use like must, and it's related to English debt. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Deber.</span><br>Deber. Deber. Good. So, deber is to owe or must. And if you say would owe you get should. So, how would you say I should? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Debería.</span><br>Good. So now we can say I should have canceled, and this have is to have. I should to have canceled .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Lo debería haber cancelado.</span><br>Very good. Lo debería haber cancelado. Where else could that lo go there? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>It's after the unchanged verb, so debería haberlo cancelado.</span><br>Yeah, debería haberlo cancelado. Very good. What was could? So, we take to be able and we say would be able to get this could, this could that refers to future. So, what is to be able, related to power? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Poder.</span><br>Poder. Good. So how would you say I would be able or I could? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Podería.</span><br>Okay, .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Podría haber ido.</span><br>Podría haber ido. We could have gone. We could have gone .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Podríamos haber ido.</span><br>Good. Podríamos haber ido. Good. So, after haber, any version of haber, whether it's the 'to' form, haber, whether it's habría, any version of haber, it's going to have –ado or –ido with the following verb. But some verbs are irregular and they don't form their version after haber in this way. So, to break, related to rupture in English, was romper. Now, this after haber is not 'rompido', 'rompido' doesn't exist, it's irregular, after haber it's roto: r-o-t-o, roto. So, how would you say I have broken it? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Lo he roto.</span><br>Good. Lo he roto. I have broken them .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Se ha roto.</span><br>Se ha roto. It has broken itself. It has broken. Very good. If you had just said ha roto I would understand he, she, it or you (formal) has or have broken, and I would be waiting to hear what was broken. So, we have roto instead of 'rompido', let's say. Roto is the version of romper after haber, which means it will also count for the adjective. So, if you want to say it is broken, how would you say it? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Está roto.</span><br>Está roto. And if it was a feminine thing? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Está rota.</span><br>Está rota. To die is morir, morir. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Morir.</span><br>And the version after haber is not 'morido', it's muerto, muerto. How would you say he has died? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Ha muerto.</span><br>Ha muerto. And with morir you can hear it with se or without se, there is not really a lot of difference, sometimes the se doesn't actually make a lot of difference - ha muerto, se ha muerto - you hear both. Now, if you want to say he is dead, how do you think you would say it? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>You mean as if it's estar or ser?</span><br>We know that this type of adjective tends to go with .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Well, estar, but I could see why this specific one could also go with ser under certain circumstances.</span><br>Yes, but it doesn't, it never goes with ser. So, some of these adjectives we form in this way can go with ser, but this one can't. So, firstly, how would that be, he is dead? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Está muerto.</span><br>Está muerto. So, complicated, for example, could go with ser and estar, but muerto can't. Maybe it's not just because they are this type of adjective, that dead will go with estar, maybe it is about the way Spanish perceives the world. To be dead is a state, that the soul goes through, let's say, you don't know what is the perception behind that, or, if it's just going with estar because it's one of these adjectives. <br>So, they are interesting points to think about, and thinking about those points helps your memory, even if you are just looking out of interest and not coming to any conclusions. How would you say I'm dead (and you can use this to mean tired)? This is quite common in Spanish, if you are really tired, you can say oh, I'm dead. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estoy muerta.</span><br>Yes, feminine. Estoy muerta. Good. You can say also I die myself here, like morirse, in all different kinds of circumstances, when something's really funny, when you can't believe something, in many different circumstances you could use that, you will hear it around, but let's build it, let's see how it would sound. So, to die, morir, I die myself, making this reflexive structure, how would it sound? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>It's irregular so the 'mue' is going to come in. Muero, maybe? Muero?</span><br>Yes. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Me muero.</span><br>Me muero. Good. Me muero. So, you will hear this all the time actually in Spanish, ay, me muero, maybe from embarrassment, maybe from laughter, maybe from disbelief, it's a common thing – me muero. To open in Spanish is abrir, abrir. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Abrir.</span><br>Abrir. And if you want to say I have opened it, you say lo he abierto. So we don't have 'abrido' after haber, we have abierto. Another irregular one. Lo he abierto. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Is it with an h?</span><br>No, good question though, good that you are thinking about that. Abrir is a-b-r-i-r. Abrir becomes abierto. So, how would you say it is open? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Está abierto.</span><br>Good. Está abierto. How would you say they are open? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Están abierto.</span><br>Están, .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Están abiertos.</span><br>Good. Están abiertos. Decir and hacer, to say or to tell, decir, and to make or to do, hacer, also are irregular after haber. These two verbs are quite irregular in most places, we will pay them a little more attention later. So decir, to say or to tell, and hacer, to do and to make, are irregular after haber. Decir becomes dicho, dicho, and hacer becomes hecho; which is why they are nice to see together, because they both have this /ch/ sound. Decir becomes dicho, and hacer becomes hecho. So, how would you say I have said it? I have said it .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Lo he dicho.</span><br>Good. Lo he dicho. And what if you wanted to say I have told him? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Lo he dicho.</span><br>But what we want here is not him; what want here is to him. I have told to him .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Le he dicho.</span><br>Good. Le he dicho. Good. We have told him .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Le hemos dicho.</span><br>Good. Le hemos dicho. Good. Interestingly, dicho is also a noun. We said that some version of the verb can form the noun; sometimes it's the 'to' form, sometimes it's the 'I' form, sometimes it's the 'he, she, it' form. Here it's this form. Un dicho is a saying, a saying. Hacer after haber becomes hecho. So, how would you say I have done it or I have made it? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Lo he hecho.</span><br>Good. Lo he hecho. I should have done it. I should have done it. I should .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Debería.</span><br>I should have done it .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Debería haberlo hecho?</span><br>Yes! Debería haberlo hecho. Of course we can put the lo there because we have haber in the 'to' form. Debería haberlo hecho or lo debería haber hecho. Very good. You should have done it (informally) .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Deberías haberlo hecho.</span><br>Good. Deberías haberlo hecho. How would you say it is done? It is done .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Está hecho.</span><br>Good. Está hecho. You might also see this used like hecho en China, made in China, or hecho en España, made in Spain, you will see this on products, should be a nice reminder. So, hecho as an adjective, made or done, está hecho, it is done, it is made; but, it can also be a noun: un hecho, un hecho is a fact, and it's actually connected to the word fact, even though they look so different. There is in Spanish and English what we can call a kind of grey area between h's and f's, because in a phonetic change that occurred in Spanish many f's became silent h's, just as hecho is from hacer, fact is from to do, so 'faire', like in French, if you know some French, is to do, and fact is related to 'faire', just as hecho is related to hacer. And we can find some other connections between this f and this silent h, between English and Spanish. For example in English we have fable, a fable is a story, and a story is spoken, and from there we see the relation with hablar. Fable, hablar. We have fugitive, which is the same root as huir, h-u-i-r, huir, which means to escape or to run away in Spanish. We have hermano or hermana in Spanish, brother or sister, spelled h-e-r-m-a-n-o, or with an a on the end for hermana, and there we see the connection with fraternal. Hembra, which means female, h-e-m-b-r-a. Even within Spanish you can see this phenomenon of the h's and the f's. For example you have iron which is hierro, h-i-e-r-r-o, hierro, iron, and then you get ferrocarril, which means railways, so they look totally unrelated, but if you know that the f became the silent h and that the e split into ie you can see the connection between hierro and ferrocarril. You have profundo, profundo, profound, in Spanish, as you do in English, and then you have hondo, which means deep, so hondo is the 'fundo' bit of profundo, but with some changes, hondo, h-o-n-d-o to mean deep. Fumar means to smoke. And then humo, h-u-m-o, is smoke, like a noun, el humo, the smoke. So there are some interesting things we can find between English and Spanish and within Spanish itself with these f's and h's. Also you can look out for some connections with other letters, you will find other pairs of letters like this, for example w's and g's – you get war in English and guerra in Spanish, William in English and Guillermo in Spanish. <br>So this is an interesting thing to keep an eye out for to make connections between vocabulary and, of course, in this way aid your memory.<br>-- end of track --" ]

 [ " <span class='ans'>Vamos a Estados Unidos.</span><br>Vamos a Estados Unidos. We discussed the concept before about working backwards.

We can use Unidos to work backwards to work out what is the verb to unite. How do you think that is? .." ] ,

Now, the one that you may have heard before is probably going to feel more natural even if you didn't register it, so if you heard before the correct version, it's going to feel more natural, and also, the more words you learn in Spanish the greater intuition you get about the phonetics of Spanish, what sounds more Spanish. So, that should direct you when you say 'Uner, Unir, Uner, Unir', to understand which one is to unite. Which one do you think it is? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Somehow I think that it's unir.</span><br>Unir. But, at this stage there is no reason for you to know what sounds more Spanish; this intuition is something that occurs with practice and exposure and listening. But working backwards is a useful skill that we want to employ in our language-learning journey. <br>So, we said that prepositions won't come at the end, so if we say, for example, the girl I work with, in Spanish we will say the girl with which, with that, with who, I work.

No sé con cual quiere hacerlo, I don't know with which one he wants to do it, I don't know which one he wants to do it with. So, we don't put the preposition at the end of the sentence in Spanish, we will rearrange the sentence and whilst this sounds more formal in English, of course it doesn't sound more formal in Spanish, it's just the only correct option.

 [ " <span class='ans'>Lo interesante es que viven aquí.</span><br>Very good. Lo interesante es que viven aquí. Very good. How would you say the interesting thing is that they live together? Now, the word for together in Spanish is junto, junto. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Junto.</span><br>This is the singular masculine version. J-u-n-t-o. Now, it's related to junction, it doesn't sound like it, but when you realize that junto is with j, then you can see how it's related to junction in English and join. The interesting thing is that they live together .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Lo interesante es que viven junto?</span><br>Good, but it's them, no? They, viven .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Juntos.</span><br>Good. Lo interesante es que viven juntos. Or, if they were two females, you would say .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Juntas.</span><br>Good. Lo interesante es que viven juntas. The interesting thing is that they live together. What do you think fácil means? Fácil .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Easy.</span><br>Easy. Why? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Facilitate.</span><br>Facilitate. Good. To facilitate is to make easy, so, we have fácil, easy. So, if you wanted to say the easy thing, how would you say that? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Lo fácil.</span><br>Lo fácil, and then you will carry on, so we can say the easy thing is that they come together. The easy thing is that they come together .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Lo fácil es que, venir is irregular, right?</span><br>Try and build it, see what happens, go there first and then see. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>It's not 'vieno', no it's vengo.</span><br>But you are going for the 'they' version, so don't go from venir to 'I' version to 'they' version. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>But I might as well remember it.</span><br>Why? That's how you get lost, right? What you want to do is focus your thoughts on just what you have in front of you, which is going from venir to the 'they' form, and try to build it as it should be, and then when you get that result, then have a look at maybe if it's irregular, if it doesn't feel right - .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>So, is it vienen?</span><br>Of course! You see? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Yeah. The 'I' one though! My mind is trying to remember.</span><br>Vengo. But it's not important, if you don't need it now it shouldn't be important for you, because with everything you will remember, you will remember something similar that you don't remember. If you let that occupy your thoughts then you are gonna block. You need to be comfortable with a level of uncertainty to learn a language. If you want to have the whole panorama of the whole language before you start speaking, you will never start speaking. And sooner or later we are gonna come across again that thought that distracted us cause we are gonna want to say it, and in that moment we will sort it out. So, the more we do that, the more you are gonna control this panorama of Spanish, that makes you a little bit insecure right now, because you know so much and you feel like it's all floating around. The easy thing is that they come together .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Lo fácil es que vienen juntos.</span><br>Good. Lo fácil es que vienen juntos. Very good. How would you say the complicated thing is that they come together .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Complicación – complicar – complicado?</span><br>Yeah. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>So, lo complicado es que vienen juntos.</span><br>Lo complicado es que vienen juntos. Good. So we can say lo bueno, the good thing; lo malo, the bad thing. Malo is bad, like in malnutritioned, that means badly nutritioned, so that's a useful structure. Before we said de esta forma, in this way, de esta forma. We could also say de esta manera, in this manner, but very very common in Spanish when we want to say like this, like that, is the word así, a-s-i, así. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Así.</span><br>Así means like this or like that. So, if you want to say something like we don't speak like this, we don't speak in that way, you don't really need to say de esa manera or de esa forma, you can just take this wonderful shortcut for like this or like that, which is así. So, like this, like that, así. <br>So, we don't speak like that, we don't speak in that way .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>No hablamos así.</span><br>No hablamos así. We don't eat like that .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>No comemos así.</span><br>No comemos así. We don't live like that .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>No vivimos así.</span><br>No vivimos así. Good. Another interesting thing that we can do with lo, a useful structure we can make with lo, is lo de. The combination of lo and de means like the thing about. So we see how lo can sometimes replace thing, lo interesante, the interesting thing, and lo de is like the thing about. So, for example, if you wanted to say the thing about the party, you just say lo de la fiesta. So if you want to say we are speaking about the thing about the party - not we are speaking about the party, but we are speaking about that issue of the party, that thing we know what we are referring to, we are speaking about that business about the party, hablamos lo de la fiesta. Or hablamos sobre, about, you could say that as well, hablamos sobre lo de la fiesta. You can even say de, we speak of, hablamos de lo de la fiesta. You can say that business about Juan, that thing about Juan, how would you say that? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Lo de Juan.</span><br>Lo de Juan. Good. So, you could say I don't want to speak about Juan's business like this, I don't want to speak about Juan's business like this. And for Juan's business you will just say .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Lo de Juan.</span><br>Good. So, I don't want to speak about Juan's business like this .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>No quiero hablar de lo de Juan así.</span><br>Good. No quiero hablar de lo de Juan así. Or we could say no quiero hablar sobre lo de Juan así, or just no quiero hablar lo de Juan así. So, lo de we kinda wanna see as a unit, meaning that thing about. And we've seen already that de can mean about, so it's just it about, that thing about. It's used very often in Spanish and you will find it very useful. So, you could say, for example, I want to organize that thing tomorrow. That thing tomorrow, that thing about tomorrow. I want to organize, what's to organize? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Organizar.</span><br>Good. So, I want to organize that thing about tomorrow .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Quiero organizar lo de la mañana?</span><br>La mañana is the morning. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Oh, sorry, tomorrow.</span><br>Yes, so morning and tomorrow are the same word in Spanish, mañana. If you say la mañana we are going to understand the morning. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>So it's just mañana.</span><br>Good, so all together .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Quiero organizar lo de mañana.</span><br>Very good. Quiero organizar lo de mañana. It about tomorrow, the thing about tomorrow. Quiero organizar lo de mañana. But I don't want to organize it like this, but I don't want to organize it like this .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Pero no quiero organizarlo así.</span><br>Good. Pero no quiero organizarlo así. Good. But I don't want to organize it like this. Or, if you wanted to be more emphatic, you could replace así with de esta manera, de esta forma, of this way, of this form, but así is the most common, you will be hearing it all the time.<br>-- end of track --" ]

 [ " Track 58 <br> We have one more time in Spanish to learn, one more verb time, and that's the point in the past. The one that usually we would express with -ed in English: wanted, walked, or, you know, the irregular versions: ran, ate. This is the point in the past and it's much more random than the other tenses that we looked at. The point in the past is a little bit more messy, but we will find some logic in it, just not the same one that we've been seeing until now. So, we will practice with hablar for –ar verbs and with comer for –er/-ir verbs, and we will use these verbs as our hooks that we can look back to when we need to remember one of these endings.

But of course no Spanish speaker hears that, when they hear todavía, just like when we say expressions like as well, we don't think that that's built of as and well. So, the words, sometimes the small words we build these bigger words out of in English and in Spanish, don't make much sense to us most of the time, but for a learner it's useful for you to divide a word like todavía, because it's long and you might find it difficult to remember, and if you identify that it's toda and vía, even if that doesn't really make any sense with the meaning of yet and still, it's gonna help you internalize that vocabulary.

 [ " <span class='ans'>Habló durante media hora sin parar.</span><br>Good. Habló durante media hora sin parar. And we said that after prepositions, so sin is a preposition, we are not saying stoppING, we are saying to stop – sin parar, 'without to stop'. Habló durante media hora sin parar. Parar is interesting, because par, par, in Spanish means pair, so un par is a pair. So, like a pair of shoes, un par de zapatos, un par de zapatos. So, parar, to stop, might be 'the pairing', you can imagine this kind of time and space notion of two things pairing, reaching each other and then stopping. And then comparar, to compare, is 'with pairing'. So, even though this is an m here, it's con, the n has been softened by that p, which is why we say compare. So, 'with pairing' is to compare. Prepare, of course, is 'pre-pairing', we can see this in English as well. Repair, to repair is to 're-pair', to pair up again. Separar is to separate in Spanish, separation, separación, separar; and this se- means apart, so to separate is to 'pair apart', to 'pair apart'.<br>-- end of track --" ]

Cuando hablamos, comprendo todo. But, if you wanted to say when we spoke I understood everything, then, of course, the first bit is going to be the same, but that second bit, I understood everything, is going to give you that context.

Desesperado in Spanish, again one of these -ado/-ido adjectives from the version that comes after haber. You can see desesperar – desesperado, which made desperate. And it's desesperado in Spanish, not 'desperado', like we have some spanishisms, let's say, that have entered English, but they can enter incorrectly, like 'desperado' is desesperado in Spanish; or in English you might hear 'no problemo', this is loosely based on Spanish, but of course, problem in Spanish is problema, not 'problemo', and actually you would say ningun problema, not 'no problema'. So, esperar, to wait or to hope. So, talking generally, we wait a lot, we wait around a lot .." ] ,

There we see in that sentence, perdemos for present and perdimos for past. But, of course, with -ir verbs, they have the same version for both. So, we could say, for example, we don't go out often, but we went out yesterday. And often is a menudo, a menudo. Menudo is like a literary word that's not used very often for small, related to minute, actually, or miniscule, it's not used very often in that sense, in the sense of small.

We are looking to understand the concept of the line in time and the point in time and applying it directly in Spanish. Because in English you would never say something like I wasn't liking it. And a lot of the time it's totally interchangeable in Spanish. <br>No me gustó, no me gustaba, just means you're thinking in a different way when you say it. No me gustó, you're referring to something as an event, as something closed. And no me gustaba, you're thinking about something as an ongoing thing that occurred over a period of time. Really, a lot of the time that difference between the point and the line in time just originates in the mind. Parecer, parecer, was to seem. Parecer. .." ] ,

You might want to say, like, it was seeming good to me.

 [ " <span class='ans'>Te lo di.</span><br>Te lo di. Good. So it's not a new thing for us to have two of these small words together, nos lo, te lo, me lo. What we didn't see so far is having two words together, two of these small words together, where both of them begin with l. That's because in Spanish, when that happens, a phonetic change occurs. So for example, if I wanted to say I gave it to him, it should be le lo di. But - and this isn't about grammar, it's about phonetics, it's about sound - Spanish doesn't like that. Spanish doesn't like the sound of those two l's together: le lo. Doesn't like it. So where we would have le lo, les lo, les los, le los, any combination of /l/-/l/ together with these small words, the first one is going to turn into se. So another se. Ah? But a totally different use, and it's not changing any meaning, it's just a phonetic issue. So this means that le lo, les lo, become se lo. So how would you say I gave it to him? .." ] ,

It's got nothing to do with the different meanings that we saw for se, like himself and herself that we saw before. Ah? It's just a phonetic change because Spanish doesn't like having these two l's together. Se lo di: I gave it to you guys, <br>I gave it to them, I gave it to him, I gave it to her, I gave it to you (formal). How would you say I gave them to him? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Se los di.</span><br>Perfect. Well done. Se los di. So, of course this means that there could be many ambiguities.

I gave him something .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Le di algo.</span><br>Le di algo. So in this case, we might want to clarify as well, because of course le di algo could mean I gave him something, I gave her something, I gave you (formal) something. So how do we make that clarification? It's simple. We repeat the whole sentence, and then we say afterwards to him, to her. For example, le di algo a él, le di algo a ella. How would you clarify I gave something to you, speaking formally? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Le di algo a usted.</span><br>Good. Le di algo a usted. So actually, we're repeating, no? We don't get rid of that le because we put a usted, which is excellent for the learner. Because it means you don't have to worry about changing the structure of the sentence when you're clarifying, using this a to clarify, because you're repeating. Now, we saw before we didn't have this situation. For example, we could say me lo compra, he buys it for me, or lo compra para mí. We don't repeat the me there. But with this a, with this a that we use to clarify, we will always repeat. Le di algo a él. It's like an afterthought. Le di algo a ella.

 [ " <span class='ans'>L-  ..  se lo vendí.</span><br>Very good. It would be le lo vendí, but we don't like this sound in Spanish, so we just say se lo vendí. But of course, se lo vendí is very ambiguous. Most of the time we're going to know what we're talking about because of the context. Usually when we're speaking we mentioned already what or who we're speaking about. But if you want to clarify it, if you want to be emphatic, you can add on afterwards to him. So, how would you do that? I sold it to him .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Se lo vendí a él.</span><br>Good. So we're just repeating. Se lo vendí a él. This is probably because this a is actually quite flexible. We can use it to clarify, but not just for the preposition to. For example, if I say me lo compra a mí, and I use this a to emphasize mí, a mí, to me literally, could mean from me, he buys it from me. Or it could mean for me, he buys it for me. Me lo compra a mí. So this a is a bit special. We're using it to clarify and it can replace or represent other prepositions, other than to, which is its literal translation. And because it has this special use, we are always repeating witha. <br>Whereas, as we saw before, with the other prepositions, we are not repeating. Me lo compra, lo compra para mí. No repetition there. But if we use a to make this clarification, we repeat. Me lo compra a mí. Ah? So you repeat. Se lo vendí a él. How would you say I sold it to her? .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Se lo envió.</span><br>Good. You want to clarify, go ahead. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>A ella.</span><br>Good. Se lo envió a ella. And of course we could clarify he as well. Él se lo envió a ella. So it's like you have this base structure, se lo envió, and you can clarify around it. Él se lo envió. Se lo envió a ella. Él se lo envió a ella. But what is not changing there is that bit, se lo envió. He sent it to them .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Ah, todavía.</span><br>Todavía. Good. So, no se lo envió a ustedes todavía. No se lo envió todavía a ustedes, could go that way around as well. I don't know if I sent it to him, I don't know if I sent it to him .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>No sé si envié – lo envié – se lo envié.</span><br>Good. No sé si se lo envié. Excellent. So when we're using this a for clarification or emphasis, we are repeating. Se lo envié a él. Se lo compré a ella. So we repeat when we're using this a for emphasis or for clarification. But if we use another preposition, like para for example, lo compré para usted, lo compré para ti. Then we don't repeat. So these very specific details of language, I don't want anybody to worry or stress about remembering or memorizing them. Remember, as long as you are actively listening and analyzing the Spanish that you expose yourself to, even if you forget it now, you will notice it again for yourself through listening, analyzing, comparing, with the skills that we've developed during this course.

 [ " <span class='ans'>Hacer.</span><br>Hacer. Good. How would you say it does or it makes? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Hace.</span><br>Hace. Good. Now hace, you can use like ago. Like in English when you say two weeks ago, you can say it makes two weeks in Spanish, and you get that meaning. So week is semana. Two is - do you remember two? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Dos.</span><br>Dos. So two weeks ago, you will say it makes two weeks .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Hace dos semanas.</span><br>Hace dos semanas. I saw him two weeks ago .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Lo vi hace dos semanas.</span><br>Good. Lo vi hace dos semanas. Good. To respond is responder. Responder. How would you say I responded? .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>La respondí. Le. Le respondí.</span><br>Good. Le respondí. I responded to her. I responded to her seven weeks ago. Do you remember how to say seven? Related to September .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Siete.</span><br>Siete. Good. So I responded to her seven weeks ago .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Le respondí hace siete semanas.</span><br>Good. Le respondí hace siete semanas. Now in Spanish, you can say I responded her it. For example, I responded to her letter or I responded to her mail. Instead of saying it this way, to her mail, in Spanish you can just say I responded him the mail. I responded her the mail. Or if you know what you are talking about, I responded him it. I responded her it. This is because, and something we'll look at again later, Spanish does not use possessive words as much as English does. So, it would be much more natural in Spanish, I responded her the mail. I responded him the mail, instead of I responded to her mail. So how would you say I responded her it, which isn't great English, but it's perfect Spanish? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Se lo respondí.</span><br>Good. Se lo respondí. So the se is actually le, to her. The lo is el mail and you get se lo respondí. I responded to her the mail. Good. Month is mes. Mes. M-e-s. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Mes.</span><br>It's a masculine word, so how would you say the month? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>El mes.</span><br>Good, and how would you say a month or one month? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Un mes.</span><br>Un mes. So un mes can be a month or one month. So how would you say I responded it to her one month ago? I responded to her mail, I responded her it one month ago .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Se lo respondí hace un mes.</span><br>Good. Se lo respondí hace un mes. Good. So we have respondí. I responded. How would you say he, she, it, you (formal) responded? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Respondió.</span><br>Good. Respondió. And we responded .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Respondimos.</span><br>Good. Respondimos. So respondí, respondió, respondimos. Let's make a quick recap with an -ar verb. How would you say discrimination? .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Descriminación.</span><br>In English we say discrimination or descrimination? .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Discriminamos.</span><br>Good. So we have two more people to learn for the point in the past. They and you informal. Let's begin with you informal. For you informal, in the point in the past we have -aste for -ar verbs and -iste for -er/-ir verbs. -aste for -ar verbs and -iste for -er/-ir verbs. So how would you say you spoke, speaking informally? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Hablaste.</span><br>Hablaste. And you ate, speaking informally .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>¿Saliste?</span><br>¿Saliste? Good. You didn't go out last night? Last night is anoche. Anoche. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Anoche.</span><br>Now if you translate tonight directly, what you will come up with is anoche. So you must be careful not to get confused here. How do you say tonight in Spanish? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Esta noche.</span><br>Esta noche. 'This night'. So anoche is last night, not tonight. So how would you say did you go out last night (speaking informally)? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>¿Saliste anoche?</span><br>Good. ¿Saliste anoche? Didn't you go out last night? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>¿No saliste anoche?</span><br>Good. ¿No saliste anoche? What was to live? .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Donde.</span><br>Donde. Where did you live? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>¿Dónde viviste?</span><br>¿Dónde viviste? Where were you living? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>So that's the line. ¿Dónde vivías?</span><br>Good. ¿Dónde vivías? So in many cases both line and point are perfectly fine. ¿Dónde viviste? ¿Dónde vivías? All that means is that the speaker has two different ideas in their mind. Maybe you go abroad to study and I'll tell you ¿dónde viviste? Or maybe I'll tell you ¿dónde vivías? <br>¿Dónde viviste? Where did you live? And this idea in my mind which is this closed amount of time. Where were you living? just means the idea in my mind is an ongoing idea of time. So many times it is completely interchangeable. What was to wait? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Esperar.</span><br>Esperar. Esperar. So for you informal, we have -aste for the point in the past. So how would you say you waited, speaking informally? .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>¿Me esperaste?</span><br>¿Me esperaste? Didn't you wait for me? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>¿No me esperaste?</span><br>Why didn't you wait for me? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>¿Por qué no me esperaste?</span><br>Good. ¿Por qúe no me esperaste? What was to arrive? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Llegar.</span><br>Llegar. Good. How do you say when did you arrive? When did you arrive? (informally) .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>¿Cuándo llegaste?</span><br>Good. ¿Cuándo llegaste? This is an example of when you would need the point, because you probably wouldn't want to say when were you arriving, no? So here's very strongly the point in time. When did you arrive? ¿Cuándo llegaste? So we have -aste and -iste for you informal. For they, we have -aron for -ar verbs and -ieron for -er/-ir verbs. So, how would you say they spoke? They spoke .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Hablaron.</span><br>Hablaron. They waited .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Esperaron.</span><br>Good. They prepared it .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Lo prepararon.</span><br>Lo prepararon. Good. We have -aron for -ar verbs and -ieron, i-e-r-o-n, for -er/-ir verbs. How would you say they ate? .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Salieron.</span><br>Salieron. They sold them .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Los vendieron.</span><br>Good. Los vendieron. Good. So let's have a quick review of the panorama of this point in the past with hablar and comer which we might want to use as our hooks. So we'll begin with hablar. How do you say I spoke? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Hablé.</span><br>Hablé. He spoke .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Habló.</span><br>Habló. We spoke .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Hablaron.</span><br>Hablaron. Good. Hablé, habló, hablamos, hablaste, hablaron. Now let's do the same for comer, so for -er/-ir verbs. How do you say I ate? .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Comimos.</span><br>Comimos. Good. You ate (informally) .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Comiste.</span><br>Comiste. And they ate .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Comieron.</span><br>Comieron. So what's very interesting here is that for -er/-ir verbs in the present, we had /e/ popping up everywhere. Vive, viven, vives and just one /i/. Just one /i/ sound. Just one i popping up, vivimos. But everything else was /e/ for -er/-ir verbs in the present, but in the past for -er/-ir verbs we have i dominating the stage. We have the i, /i/ sound everywhere and this time the letter e, the /e/ sound, occupying only one space. Popping up in only one place which is -ieron. Comí, comió, comiste, comimos, comieron, which is the exact inverse of what happens in the present tense. We can see also a logic that crosses over between the -ar group and the -er/-ir group. For example, we have I spoke, how is it? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Hablé.</span><br>Hablé. And he spoke .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Habló.</span><br>Habló. We saw the -er/-ir in this past point has a special affiliation to the /i/ sound, the i, the letter i. So whilst we have hablé for -ar verbs, for -er/-ir verbs what do we have? How would we say I ate? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Comí.</span><br>Comí. And whilst we have habló for -ar verbs, what do we have for -er/-ir verbs? How would you say he ate? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Comió.</span><br>Comió. So it's like the -ar version, but with that important /i/ popping up again. We have, for we spoke, what do we have? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Hablamos.</span><br>Hablamos. And for we ate .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Comimos.</span><br>Comimos. That important /i/, the i, the /i/ sound again. For you (informal) spoke, what do we have? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Hablaste.</span><br>Hablaste. But you ate .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Comiste.</span><br>Comiste. You remembered the importance of that i. Comiste. They spoke .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Hablaron.</span><br>Hablaron. And they ate .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Comieron.</span><br>Comieron. Again that important i and that e getting just one small look in, in that dot in the past to remind us that this is -er/-ir group, not just -ir. Just as what happened the other way around in the present. Good.<br>-- end of track --" ]

 [ " <span class='ans'>Todo.</span><br>Todo. Good. If you make this plural, todos, you get everybody. Everybody, or you might also hear in Spanish todo el mundo. 'All the world' to say everybody, but todos is very common. So everybody arrived at my house at the same time .." ] ,

Now the word for our is nuestro. Our house is nuestra casa. Nuestra casa. We can see the o splitting of nosotros there in nuestro, nuestra. So that's our. So how would you say did you visit our house? What is to visit? Visitation .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Visitación. Visitar.</span><br>Good. So did you visit our house, speaking informally .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Estoy con, is it mis amigos?</span><br>Yes. Estoy con mis amigos. So the words for possession, mi, tu, nuestro can change for number to match the number: mi amigo, mis amigos. And if it ends in -o like nuestro, it can change for gender as well. Nuestro amigo, nuestra amiga. So we have mi/my, tu/your, nuestro or nuestra/our. For his/her/their/your (speaking formally), for all of that, we have the same word which is su. Su. S-u. .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Quiero ir a su casa.</span><br>Good. Quiero ir a su casa. So it's the same. If you put it in plural or not refers to the things that are possessed, not the possessors. So avoid any temptation to say sus, because you mean they. You are only going to say sus if you are saying houses, for example. So if you were to say I want to go to their houses, there you can put it in plural. How would that be? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Quiero ir a sus casas.</span><br>Good. Quiero ir a sus casas. And I want to go to his houses, I want to go to his houses .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Quiero ir a sus casas.</span><br>Exactly. The same. Quiero ir a sus casas. So these possessive words mi, tu, nuestro, su, they refer to the thing being possessed, rather than the possessor when they're changing. If you want to say my own house, if you want to say my own house or my very own house, you can say mi propia casa. Like property. Mi propia casa. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Mi propia casa.</span><br>Good. How would you say my own car? .." ] ,

 [ " Track 66 <br> So, we are looking a bit at possession now, and how we express that in Spanish. Now, in English we use possessive words: my, your, his, her, much more than we do in Spanish. So, it's something we want to look out for. We already saw an example actually, for example, how we would say I responded him the mail, rather than I responded to his mail. Another example would be how we refer to body parts in Spanish. So you don't say in Spanish, for example, my leg hurts, you say it hurts me the leg. Doler, doler, is to hurt. How would you say, firstly, it hurts me, from doler? It hurts me .." ] ,

 [ " Track 67 <br> I would like to talk a little bit more about writing in Spanish. So, we haven't really looked so much about how to read and write in Spanish, we've spelled some words, we've discussed some sounds and we've looked at convertible words, convertible words that we convert over from Latin English into Spanish, and they give us a great idea about how to read and write in Spanish. <br>For example, if we have a /j/ sound, for example in general, how is this pronounced in Spanish? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>/kheneral/.</span><br>/kheneral/. And it's spelled the same. So, there we understand that g-e makes /khe/ sound without having to learn it formally, we can just look back to these convertible words when we are unsure of how a sound might be pronounced. So, maybe you see c-e together and you are like 'is that /se/ or is that /ke/?' But then if you look back to concentración, then you have your answer: 'con-cen': c-e, concentración gives you your answer. So, apart from the actual sounds we also need to understand where the stress in any given word is when we read it. So, in Spanish, you may have noticed you have written accents, little dashes above some vowels. Now, this isn't like French, for example, where the little dashes might actually change the sound of the vowel. None of that, luckily, is going on in Spanish. The written accent is just showing the stress, but why do we have it sometimes and not other times? So, there is a general rule in Spanish, which is: if the word ends in a vowel, an n, or an s, the accent should be on the penultimate syllable, on the second last syllable. Now, why do you think vowels and then n's and s's have been singled out for that role, what if you look at our verbs? What do our verb forms end in? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Well the 'they' end in an n.</span><br>Right. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Ah yes, s as well.</span><br>Or? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Vowel.</span><br>Exactly. So, it's what our verbs end in: an n, s, or vowel. So, Spanish says if a word ends in n, s, or a vowel, then natural accent will be on the penultimate syllable, the second last syllable. <br>Diferente, habla, hablan, hablas, hablamos, ending s, but we are adding two syllables, so still on the second last, hablamos. Importante, adictivo. Now, if the word ends in any other consonant, any other consonant that's not n or s, then the natural accent place is to go to the end of the word, and we see this perfectly with any 'to' verb. How do you say to eat? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Comer.</span><br>Accent on the end. Comer. To be, for states? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estar.</span><br>Estar. To speak .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Hablar.</span><br>Hablar. To find .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Encontrar.</span><br>Encontrar. So, this r is not an n or an s or a vowel, and what that means is that the accent is coming on the end. So, these are our natural accents, and if the word obeys the rules of the natural accents, we have no written accent, generally, there's a couple of exceptions which I will mention. So, if there is no written accent, you follow those rules. If it ends n, s, or vowel, you put the accent on the second last syllable, and if it ends in any other consonant you are putting the accent on the end. But if your word breaks this rule, then you have a written accent to show you where you should be stressing. So, for example, what is tradition in Spanish? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Tradición.</span><br>Tradición. And what are you ending it with? What is the last letter? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>n.</span><br>And where is the accent? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>At the end.</span><br>At the end. Does this break our rule? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Yes.</span><br>So, the /o/ will have a written accent, that last o will have a written accent on the end, showing you that you are stressing it. Tradición. So, all of these –ión words, that all have their accent on the end - situación, opinión - they all have a written accent there on the end. So, now I'm gonna tell you some words, that we've come across already, and I want you to tell me if they will have a written accent or not. So, what you need to decide is 'are they breaking the accent rule or not'. <br>Encuentro. Encuentro. Firstly, what does that mean, encuentro? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>I encounter.</span><br>Good, I find. Encuentro. Do we have a written accent there? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>No.</span><br>No, good. Encontró. What does that mean first, encontró? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>I- sorry. He/she/it or you (formal) found.</span><br>Good. And does it have a written accent? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Yes.</span><br>Yes, because it's breaking the rule, we're ending in a vowel and we have the accent on the end. So, all of these, in that point in the past, are gonna have the accent. Encontró, habló, llamó, llegó. Good. Vive. Vive. Firstly, what does that mean? Vive .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>He/she/it/you (formal) live.</span><br>Good. Does it have an accent? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>No.</span><br>Good. Vivió .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>It has an accent.</span><br>Where? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>At the o.</span><br>Good. Vivió – he lived, she lived, you (formal) lived, it lived. Limón, what do you think limón means? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Lemon.</span><br>Lemon. Good. Which is a Persian word actually, and it actually was used to talk about citrus fruits generically, generally, and lime came from the same word, so lemon and lime is actually the same word essentially. Does it have an accent, limón? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Yes.</span><br>Yes, cause it should be LI-mon, right, but it's not, it's li-MÓN, it's breaking that rule, so it has a written accent. So, when we are reading Spanish, if the word ends in a vowel, an n, or an s, we want to put the accent on the penultimate syllable. If it ends in another consonant, we wanna put the accent on the end, unless we are shown with a written accent that the rule is being broken. Salud means health, related to salute in English. Salud, and you can say it when you toast. Does it have a written accent? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>No.</span><br>No, good, it ends in a d, so we expect the accent to be on the end, salud. So, usually accents are written to show us that we are breaking the accent rule, but there are some other situations where we have a written accent. One of these situations is when we have words that are monosyllables – words that are just one syllable - and we can differentiate them with a written accent. For example, how was the word for yes? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Sí.</span><br>And how was the word for if? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Si.</span><br>Si. It's the same word, so yes is written with a written accent, and if is not. Now this written accent doesn't change the pronunciation, this differentiates them so when you are reading you don't have the ambiguity that could sometimes be caused by 'oh, is that a yes or an if?', both could make sense there, especially because you use yes emphatically, in Spanish you can say sí lo quiero, yes I want it, but if that's written and you don't hear the emphasis, sí lo quiero, then you might read if I want it. <br>So, to clear up that ambiguity when you have monosyllables - words of one syllable - that are the same, one will take an accent to show the difference. How was for me? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Para mí or por mí.</span><br>Good, very good, either one, depending what for you want. Now, how was my house? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Mi casa.</span><br>Mi casa. So, this is different mi: one is the mí that comes after prepositions – para mí, por mí, de mí – and the other one is for possession – my. So, para mí: there you have the written accent on the mí of para mí, and you don't have it on mi casa, just to show the difference. What was the word for you, speaking informally? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Tú.</span><br>Tú. And what was your house? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Tu casa.</span><br>Tu casa. The word for you, tú, takes a written accent, but the word for your in your house, tu casa, doesn't. So, monosyllables that are the same are differentiated by accent. I know, how do you say I know? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Sé.</span><br>Yes, this sé has a written accent; the se of se lo doy, I give it to him, the se of se queda, he remains himself/she remains herself, doesn't have an accent; only the sé of saber, I know, has one. So, it's something you will pick up reading. Another example where we have accents is to differentiate question words from non-question words when they are the same. For example you have donde, what does donde mean? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Where.</span><br>Where. But sometimes donde is a question word, like ¿dónde estás? Where are you? There it will go with an accent, but if I say I'm going to meet him where we saw the football, this is not a question, so it doesn't have an accent, so Spanish likes to differentiate them as well. But now we are entering quite a bit of detail and many Spanish speakers, when they are writing, make these mistakes as well and don't put these accents where they should, but I'm explaining just in case you come across dónde with an accent and you don't understand why it's there because it's not breaking the accent rule – this is why. So, in the same way we have como, which means how or like, the cómo for how takes an accent and the como for like doesn't. So, there are a couple of grammatical examples, when we are having accents just to differentiate words that are the same or to differentiate question words from non-question words, but most of the time they are directing us to break the accenting rules. And it's very easy to remember the accenting rules because we only need to look at the present tense. We know that our verbs end in vowels, n's or s's, and in the present tense we always have the accent on the penultimate syllable without any written accent, with, of course, that one exception, estar, where we have estás, están, está and we do have a written accent. So we can look back there at the present tense to remind us that if the word ends n, s, or vowel, the natural accent is on the penultimate syllable, like the verbs in the present tense, and if it ends in any other letter, the natural accent is on the end of the word. And if we break this rule we show it with a written accent.<br>-- end of track --" ]

 [ " Track 69 <br> So now we have a panorama of times in Spanish. We've seen all of the different times. We can find will, would, the present, the pasts, the have tenses. Maybe some of these we are clearer on than others, but we've learned how to find what we might think we don't know and how to analyze the language, so that through listening to Spanish we can reinforce the language that we've learned and bring it to the surface and pick up again anything that we might have forgotten along the way. But there is one more tense to learn in Spanish. One more very important tense in Spanish, and personally it's my favorite thing about Spanish. In Spanish we have what we can call a mood tense, the subjunctive tense in grammatical terminology, but we will call it the mood tense because it's a tense that just shows mood. Now, you might be interested to hear that we also have it in English. Now, we don't use it as much in English as we do in Spanish but it is there. For example, in English you can say it is important that you are here or it is important that you be here. So, it's important that you are here sounds more everyday, let's say, more casual. It's important that you be here; that gives us a different feeling. It feels more serious, it feels more imperative. How are we achieving that feeling? We're using be instead of you are. We are using you be. It's important that you be here. Another example of how English uses this mood, I might say had I gone, I would know. Had I gone, I would know. Now, had I, that inversion of I had to had I usually is to make a question. Had you gone already? for example. But here it's not a question. Had I gone, I would know. Here we are creating a mood tense. We are saying if I had gone with had I gone. We also say not only is it, for example, not only is it a problem, it's the biggest problem. Not only is it, again, is it is what we do to make a question. But here it's not a question. Not only is it a problem, it's the biggest problem. So the changing of the order of is and it gives us this mood tense here in English as well. So we don't need to analyze too much how it works in English, because there's not so much correlation between English and Spanish about how it works. It's used much more extensively in Spanish. But the idea is not completely alien to us. In Spanish, it's a very common thing that will allow you and oblige you to perceive and to express the world in a certain way. Now, to form the mood tense, to form the subjunctive tense in Spanish, is very easy, and we don't need to learn any new sounds to do it. All we do is we switch between the verbs. With –ar verbs we will use the –er/-ir endings, and with –er/-ir verbs we will use the –ar verb endings. And that's how we build this tense. So, for example, how is to speak? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Hablar.</span><br>And how is he speaks? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Hablá.</span><br>Habla. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Sorry, habla. Habla.</span><br>Habla. Good. The accent there at the beginning. Habla. Now if you want to make this the mood tense, we will switch groups. We we will switch groups. Verbs from the –ar group use –er/-ir endings, and verbs from the -er/-ir group use –ar endings. So how would you make habla in the mood tense? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Hable.</span><br>Hable. Good. So you have they speak .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Hablan.</span><br>Hablan. And the mood tense version will be? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Hablen.</span><br>Hablen. Good. How is I speak? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Hablo.</span><br>Hablo. Of course if we go from hablo in the –ar group and we go to -er/-ir we will still have hablo. We will change an o for an o. So we don't do that. Hablo will also become hable. So again we have a situation where I jumps in with he, she, it, and you (formal). So hable can also be the mood tense for I. What is we speak? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Hablamos.</span><br>Hablamos. And the mood tense of we speak .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Hablemos.</span><br>Hablemos. Good. We are using the /e/, not that odd i that pops up with the –ir verbs in the present like vivimos, salimos. -emos for the mood tense. Hablemos. What was to eat? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Comer.</span><br>Comer. I eat .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Como.</span><br>Como. But the mood tense version would be? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Coma.</span><br>Good. Coma. And what else can coma mean, then? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>He/she/it version of the mood tense.</span><br>Good, and you (formal). Very good. They eat, normal tense, present tense? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Comen.</span><br>Comen. And the mood tense? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Coman.</span><br>Coman. Good. So it's going to be great to practice this mood tense, because of course you have to first think what the verb should be, and then you switch it. So we're going to have a nice practice mentally, in our mental exercises, of the tenses that we already learned whilst we are building the mood tense. So the use of the mood tense we can divide between obligatory and optional. There are some situations in which we absolutely must use the mood tense, otherwise it will be considered an error. It will sound incorrect and distract from what we are saying. And then there are cases where the use of the mood tense is optional. You can use it to give a different meaning or a different flavor or a different feeling, which is the much more exciting area, where it's optional. But the obligatory uses will allow us a very important exposure to the feeling of the mood tense. So now we're going to look at some examples. In English when you say I want you to wait, I want you to wait, this is quite a peculiar structure in English. And it's not really translated in this way in many other languages. I want you to wait. In most other Romance languages, at least, it's translated as I want that you wait. This is how we would say it in French or Portuguese or Italian. <br>So I want you to wait is I want that you wait. Now, this you wait is going to be in the mood tense. When we are expressing what we want in this way, we will use the mood tense. We are putting our subjectivity onto the world when we say I want that and following this that, we will use the mood tense. So how would you say I want you to wait? I want that you wait (informally) .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>So I want remains the same and it's quiero. That is que. And then you wait becomes espere. Sorry, esperes.</span><br>Good. All together, I want that you wait .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Quiero que esperes.</span><br>Good. Quiero que esperes. Ah? So if you say quiero que esperas, here it would be considered an error. This is an obligatory use of the subjunctive, of the mood tense. Quiero que esperes. I want you to wait for him, or I want you to wait for it .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Quiero que lo esperes.</span><br>Good. Quiero que lo esperes. I want you to wait for it or for him. Very good. Do you want me to wait? So first let's find the in-between sentence. Give it to me in English, how we will say it in Spanish. Do you want me to wait? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Do you want that I wait for you?</span><br>You made it more complicated. It's just do you want that I wait? But, let's put it. So do you want me to wait for you? Give me that one. Do you want me to wait for you? And let's speak informally. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>¿Quieres que te espere?</span><br>Very good. ¿Quieres que te espere? And of course this could mean: Do you want me to wait for you? Do you want him to wait for you? Do you want her to wait for you? So if we wanted to clarify I, how would we do that? Do you want me to wait for you? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>¿Quieres que yo te espere?</span><br>Very good. ¿Quieres que yo te espere?<br>-- end of track --" ]

So, what not as a question is lo que. How would you say I don't want you to speak about what we spoke about - but you know we don't need this about. So the first bit is I don't want you to speak, and let's speak informally. I don't want you to speak, I don't want that you speak .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>No quiero que hables.</span><br>Very good. No quiero que hables. About .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Is it de?</span><br>De, you could use, or you could use? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Sobre.</span><br>Sobre. Good. So, no quiero que hables de, or sobre what we spoke about, and we can just say what we spoke .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Lo que hablamos.</span><br>Yes. It's the same in the past. So give it to me now all together. I don't want you to speak about what we spoke about. From the beginning and thinking it through again. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>No quiero que hables sobre lo que hablamos.</span><br>Good. No quiero que hables sobre lo que hablamos, or no quiero que hables de lo que hablamos. Good. But that sentence could be ambiguous, no? I mean, in your mind, when you're creating this sentence you will have the context very strongly in your mind that you're thinking about what we spoke about the other day. But that doesn't necessarily mean that the person receiving it has that same context in their mind. They might, depends what your conversation is about. But if you don't have a context that's shared, it could be ambiguous. You could understand I don't want you to speak about what we speak about generally. Because of course we have hablamos, which can be past or present. No quiero que hables sobre lo que hablamos. Generally. So there's two ways here that you could clarify. You could add something like the other day, el otro día. No quiero que hables sobre lo que hablamos el otro día. So you are showing with some time expression that it was past. Or you could use the line in the past. What we were speaking about. Because here it's interchangeable, the meaning changes so slightly and both meanings are fine, no? If we look at English, I don't want you to speak about what we were speaking about. I don't want you to speak about what we spoke about. So maybe here in Spanish you choose the line in the past just so it's obvious that you're talking about the past. So let's give it another go, using the line in the past. I don't want you to speak about what we were speaking about. I don't want you to speak (informally still) .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>No quiero que hables sobre lo que hablábamos.</span><br>Very good. No quiero que hables sobre lo que hablábamos. Necessity in Spanish is – do you remember what to do with -ity words to make them Spanish? .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Necesito.</span><br>Necesito. I need you to prepare it. Let's speak formally. I need you to prepare it (formally) .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>In English again it would be I need that you prepare it.</span><br>Exactly. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Necesito que lo prepare.</span><br>Very good. Necesito que lo prepare. This is to you, formally. If you wanted to make it clear that you are speaking to you and not speaking about him or her, how would you do that here? I need you to prepare it .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Necesito que usted lo prepare.</span><br>Very good. Necesito que usted lo prepare. Necesito que lo prepare usted. Very good. So with quiero que, necesito que, we're seeing two things that they have in common. We have a verb like quiero, necesito, a verb that's showing what we want to occur in the world, expressing our subjectivity, let's say, in this way, and we have the structural similarity that the mood tense is coming after que. To be short of, to be short of, to be missing, to lack, is faltar. Quite uncomfortable translations, but this is a very common verb in Spanish. Faltar. It's used very often, this verb in Spanish. For example, you could say I need you to prepare what's missing. I need you to prepare what's missing. What's left over, what we need to do still, ah? So again, formally, I need you to prepare .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Necesito que prepare.</span><br>Good. What's missing. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Lo que falta.</span><br>Necesito que prepare lo que falta. And lo que because the what here is not a question. Very good. The noun is also used quite often. The noun is falta, la falta. So falta means lack, lack. So if I say falta de consideración, what does it mean? Falta de consideración .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Oh, right. Lack of consideration.</span><br>Good. Lack of consideration. It's also used with respect, falta de respeto, lack of respect. And it's also used in the expression hace falta. 'It makes lack.' 'It makes lack.' Which is just another way of saying it's necessary, but it's very common. And hace falta que of course is followed by this mood tense in the same way that we do with quiero que, necesito que, we will follow it with this mood tense. So, if you wanted to say, using hace falta, it is necessary that we eat soon, what was the word for soon? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Is it pronto, or is that Italian?</span><br>That's it. In Italian, actually, it means ready, pronto. This is why when Italians answer the phone, they say pronto, because historically, let's say, there was an operator there connecting the wires. And they were there going ready? Are you ready? Is it ready? Can you hear me? But in Spanish it's soon. Like the British slang. People say in England get here pronto, get here soon. So it makes lack, hace falta, it makes lack that we eat soon .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Sorry, can you explain again how, why does that make sense? It makes lack that we eat soon?</span><br>It makes lack would be the literal translation, but literal translations are often uncomfortable, no? Especially when we're talking about fixed expressions. So hace falta is an extremely common expression, quite difficult to translate comfortably. Just another way of saying it's necessary. So it makes lack or hace falta that we eat soon. How would it be? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Hace falta que comamos pronto.</span><br>Hace falta que comamos pronto. So hace falta you will hear around a lot, and falta as a noun, you will hear it especially in phrases like falta de respeto, a lack of respect, you hear that a lot. And faltar as a verb, to lack, or to be missing is also very useful. To prefer in Spanish is preferir. Preferir. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Preferir.</span><br>Preferir. How is I prefer? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Prefero.</span><br>It should be. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Prefiero.</span><br>Better. Prefiero. Good. So again if you say I prefer him to stay, you're not going to say I prefer him to stay, we will say I prefer that he stays, and what are we going to do with he stays? I think you're getting the gist now. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Mood tense.</span><br>Mood tense. So it's not just the structures that we are identifying, it's the feeling. This is very important for the mood tense. What you want to really get your head around is the feeling of the mood tense, so you can start experimenting about where you would use it and listening out for where you hear people using it. I prefer that he stays, I prefer for him to stay, I prefer that he stays .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Prefiero que se – que no se queden aquí.</span><br>Good. Prefiero que no se queden aquí. Very good. How would you say I prefer you to give it to him? I prefer you, speaking informally, to give it to him .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>So it's I prefer that you give it to him?</span><br>Exactly. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Prefiero que lo le – ah, se lo des.</span><br>That's it. Good. Prefiero que se lo des. So this could mean I prefer you to give it to him, to her, how would we clarify it? If we want to show it's to him. I prefer you to give it to him .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Prefiero que se lo des a él.</span><br>Very good. And what if it was to her? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>A ella. Prefiero que se lo des a ella.</span><br>Good. Prefiero que se lo des a ella. Very good. So to clarify we can then say a él, a ella, to show afterwards who we meant with se.<br>-- end of track --" ]

 [ " Track 71 <br> To count in Spanish is contar, contar. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Contar.</span><br>Contar. We can see that it's the same word, but it's also to recount, like in English how you say to recount a story. So, contar, you can also use it like to tell, especially with telling stories. How would you say I tell? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>I'm tempted to say cuento.</span><br>Cuento, you would be correct, cuento, good, the o splits. So, cuento is I tell, and cuento is the noun, meaning story, un cuento is a story. So, we can see how contar is to count, but also to recount or another verb for to tell. C-o-n-t-a-r. So, how would you say I want you to tell me, I want you to recount to me (informally)? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Quiero que me cuentes.</span><br>Good. Quiero que me cuentes. I want you to tell me something and speaking plurally now, speaking to more than one you .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Quiero que me cuenten algo.</span><br>Good. Quiero que me cuenten algo. To count on, to count on, in the sense of you can count on me, to count on is contar con, so, 'to count with' in Spanish. So, how would you say I want you to count on me? I want you to count on me (speaking informally) .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Quiero que cuentes con mi- conmigo.</span><br>Good. Quiero que cuentes conmigo. Good. I want you to count on me. Quiero que cuentes conmigo. Very good. So, we said that sometimes, between English and Spanish, that the prepositions might change, we say to count on in English and in Spanish to count with. We also spoke about how we can use the negative language transfer of Spanish speakers speaking English, that may make some mistake and we can make certain assumptions about Spanish through that. So, maybe we hear a native Spanish speaker speaking English, saying you can count with me, and if we hear that a couple of times we can understand that that's probably how it's said in Spanish. <br>So, we can take advantage of any negative language transfer we may hear from Spanish speakers in English. What was to wait or to hope? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Esperar.</span><br>Esperar. So, if you say I hope that, then of course you will also follow this up with our mood tense. So, how would you say I hope that you count on me (informally)? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Espero que cuentes conmigo.</span><br>Good. Espero que cuentes conmigo. I hope that you count on me. Good. How would you say We hope that they count on Maria? We hope that they count on Maria .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Esperamos que cuenten con María.</span><br>Good. Esperamos que cuenten con María. We hope that they count on Maria. What if you wanted to say we hope that they tell Maria it, using contar? So now we're using contar, to count, like to recount, we hope that they recount it to Maria, we hope that they tell it to Maria .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Esperamos que lo cuenten a María.</span><br>Very good. Esperamos que lo cuenten a María. So, here we have the other meaning of contar, to recount, to tell. What was to see? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Ver.</span><br>Ver. So, if we say, for example, we hope that they see Maria, what is they see in the present? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Ven.</span><br>Ven. Now, if you want to make the mood tense and you switch to the other side you would get 'van', which would probably cause, especially in the optional uses of the mood tense, a lot of confusion, because 'van' sounds like- .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Like they are going.</span><br>Yes, so, we actually build the mood tense on the I form, which was the only irregular form of ver in the present. Do you remember how to say I see? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Veo.</span><br>Veo. So, we kept the e. So, the mood tense is based on this version to avoid any ambiguity that might be caused with va, vas, van. So, how would you say I hope that they see, I hope that they see .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Espero que vean.</span><br>Good. Espero que vean. Now, if you want to say I hope that they see Maria, we will say a María. Now the literal translation doesn't make any sense: I hope that they see to Maria. In Spanish we have this personal a, that we use when we are referring to somebody that we are doing the action of the verb to. So, in this case the person that we are doing the action of seeing to, espero que vean a María. The reason for this is that the order in Spanish is quite flexible, words like María can come before the verb or after the verb, which might cause confusion about whether Maria is doing or being done to, whether David is doing or being done to. So, when it's being done to, we include this a, and when there is not any other preposition there that shows us that we are doing it to, so we saw already, for example, contar con María, there we don't need the a, but if there is no other preposition we will have to put that a. So, let's practice this. What is to understand? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Comprender.</span><br>Comprender. So, how would you say, I hope that you, speaking informally, I hope that you understand David? David. I hope that you understand David .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Espero que comprendas a David.</span><br>Good. Espero que comprendas a David. How would you say the same sentence speaking formally? I hope that you, formally, I hope that you understand David .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Espero que comprenda a David.</span><br>Good. Espero que comprenda a David. Now, we can see why this a is important, because if it weren't there, if we were to say espero que comprenda David, it would sound like I hope that David understands, because David is flexible: espero que David comprenda, espero que comprenda David would both mean I hope that David understands. So, to make it clear, this habit formed in Spanish of putting the a there. For example, the word for man was? Begins with a silent h. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Hombre.</span><br>Hombre. The man .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>El hombre.</span><br>El hombre. If you say to the man, 'a el hombre', a and el, they stick together and they form al, and it's written like this: a-l, al hombre. So, if you were to say I want him to see the man, I want that he sees the man, I want that he sees to the man, so how would that be? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Quiero que va-</span><br>We go from veo, to avoid that ambiguity. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Vea. Quiero que vea al hombre.</span><br>Good. Quiero que vea al hombre. But if you were to say: I want the man to see, I want that the man sees .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Quiero que el hombre vea.</span><br>Quiero que el hombre vea. Or quiero que vea el hombre. So, because the order is flexible, we can't just put el hombre afterwards and understand from that I want that he sees the man. If we put el hombre afterwards we will still understand I want that the man sees. So, we need to say al hombre. What was I like, it pleases me? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Me gusta.</span><br>Me gusta. So, you could say I like that the teacher visits, and here we will use the mood tense after I like that, because again you are casting your subjectivity onto the world and you show that with this mood tense. I like that the teacher visits. The teacher, we say the professor, so how is that? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>El profesor.</span><br>Good, or for female, for feminine? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>La profesora.</span><br>Very good. So, either one. I like that the teacher visits .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Me gusta que la profesora visite.</span><br>Very good. Me gusta que la profesora visite or me gusta que visite la profesora, the order is flexible. Now, if you wanted to say I like that she visits the teacher, how would that be? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Me gusta que visite la profesora.</span><br>So I still understand from this sentence: I like that the teacher visits, because the order, the word order is not changing the information for us, because the word order is flexible. So, me gusta que visite la profesora, I like that the teacher visits. But, if we want to make it understood I like that he visits the teacher, how are we going to clear that up? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Me gusta que visite a la profesora.</span><br>Good. Me gusta que visite a la profesora. Very good. So, to clarify, it's not just when there might be some ambiguity that we have to use this personal a, we always need to use this a when the human that we mention is having the action of the verb done to them and there is no other preposition present. Now, I say the human, not a human, because it's when we refer to a specific person, and whilst this personal a is generally used with humans, we might also see it as a way of personifying non-humans, so some people use it with pets, for example, or it can be used in some creative ways, for example, a la muerte, escapar a la muerte, to escape death, and using this personal a in this expression personifies death, but generally speaking, we will use it with humans, and with specific humans, when we are referring to a specific person. So, for example, I need to find the plumber – there we would use the personal a, I need to find a plumber – there we wouldn't. So, it's important to listen out for it and to analyze, when you hear it, to understand why it was used, and this is the way we internalize this kind of quite specific details that we find in language. And the reason why I keep stressing the importance of listening is to practice this thinking process, to practice analyzing the language and becoming our own teachers. This is how language becomes something fascinating and pleasant to learn instead of frustrating and painful.<br>-- end of track --" ]

This helps our ear tune into the fact that it's a command. Because other than that vowel changing, which is a very small change which might be quite hard to pick up audibly, we also have these small little words like me or lo coming after the verb and that also helps our ear tune into the fact that it's a command.

So, we are using the mood tense to make commands, with one exception. The one exception is with positive informal commands. So, what that means is when we are speaking informally and we are telling somebody to do something, rather than not to do something. The reason why we don't use the mood tense here is because we want a shortcut, it's what we do most, to tell people informally what to do. If you think about it, all day you are saying wait here, buy this, call me later, do that and the other, it's such common speech that it seemed a bit heavy to use the mood tense for this.

So, our shortcut is dropping the s of the present for the positive commands, which are informal, it's something that's quite specific, positive commands informally, but it's something that we do all day and that should help us remember that we have this shortcut for it. Callar, c-a-l-l-a-r, callar, means to quiet, and callarse, callarse, means to shut up. So, how would you tell somebody to shut up, informally? .." ] ,

 [ " Track 73 <br> So we've seen how with orders we want to use this mood tense, with the exception of positive orders which are informal. There we have a shortcut, we can just cut off the s of the informal form. For example, what is to wait? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Esperar.</span><br>And what is you wait, informally? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Esperas.</span><br>Esperas. And wait, the order .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Espera.</span><br>Espera. That's our shortcut. How would you say let's wait? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Esperemos.</span><br>Esperemos. Good. And you can also say esperamos, it just sounds less like an order. It would sound more like shall we wait? ¿Esperamos? Shall we wait? But then the order, esperemos. Let's not wait .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>No esperemos.</span><br>No esperemos. Good. So orders, we are using with you, the different versions of you, and with we. But maybe I want to say what I want him to do, or what I want her to do, or what I want them to do. Other than the structures that we learned already, quiero que, prefiero que, etc, we can just say que and follow it with the subjunctive. So for example, maybe you tell me David is waiting for you and I say que espere. Que espere. That he waits, but I'm using this mood tense so I'm saying let him wait. Let him wait. Que espere. Maybe I really want the show to finish. I want the show to hurry up and finish. I can say que, it finishes in the mood tense and then I get that meaning of let it finish. Hurry up and finish. So how would I say that? Let it finish .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Que termine.</span><br>Que termine. Good. Que termine. We said that the word for already was ya. And we can use that here, so let it finish already .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Que termine ya.</span><br>Que termine ya. Enough already. We said that callarse was to quiet oneself or to shut up. So maybe you want somebody to shut up. You're not angry enough to tell them directly. Maybe you will just say oh, let them, let him shut up. Let him quiet himself. How would that be? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Que se calle.</span><br>Good. Que se calle. Another situation that we use the mood tense in, is when after the word cuando, we refer to the future. For example, if I say when we speak and I mean generally, how will it sound? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Cuando hablamos.</span><br>Cuando hablamos. So this is generally, when we speak generally and you could continue, no? <br>But, if you mean in a future event, when we speak later on, then you will use this mood tense. Now this is a very interesting use of the mood tense because it highlights some kind of superstition maybe that the language is uncomfortable with referring to something in the future that didn't happen yet as a fact. So you're putting this mood tense there to kind of highlight that subjectivity. Give me when we speak then. When we speak, and we mean the future. When we speak .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Cuando hablemos.</span><br>Cuando hablemos. We are using this mood tense because we are referring to something that's going to happen in the future that we give it as a fact. And it's like who are we as mere mortals to do such a thing, to refer to this event or to this fact that will be. So for example, you could say when we eat together, we speak. And you mean generally. When we eat together, we speak. What was together? Related to junction, related to joint? Related to what in English they say military junta. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Junta.</span><br>So how would you say when we eat together, we speak? When we eat together, we speak .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Cuando comemos junta.</span><br>Junta is the version you found through military junta, but you are not just going to take it, you are going to have to process it as well. When we eat together .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Juntas. <br>For two females, that's fine. So cuando comemos juntas. We speak .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Hablamos.</span><br>Good. All together. When we eat together, we speak .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Cuando comemos juntas, hablamos.</span><br>Good. Cuando comemos juntas, hablamos. So here you're speaking generally, generalmente, generally. When we eat together, we speak, but if you want to say when we eat together and you're referring to the future. A fact that you're naming that hasn't happened yet, there you want to use your mood tense. So let's work our way through it. When we eat together, and we're referring to the future .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Cuando comamos juntas.</span><br>We will speak, and we don't need will with we will speak because the when we eat together is a future context. We can just go back to normal everyday present again. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Hablamos.</span><br>Good. Cuando comamos juntas (two females) when we eat together, hablamos, we will speak. Now hablamos is just normal present because it is not directly connected to cuando and we have future context already so we can just use hablamos. So if we compare these two sentences, the only difference is in that mood tense. Cuando comemos juntos, hablamos. This means generally. I went back to male or mixed group. Cuando comemos juntos, hablamos, generally. Cuando comamos juntos, hablamos. When we eat together, we will speak. What is I go or I'm going? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Voy.</span><br>Voy. Now you could probably guess that the mood tense of voy and va and vamos is irregular. So the root is vaya, v-a-y-a, vaya. And then we add on our consonants if we need them, so for example the they form or the you plural form would be? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Vayan.</span><br>Vayan. We form .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Vayamos. Good. So how would you say we see her when we go, and you're speaking generally? We see her .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>La vemos.</span><br>La vemos. When we go, generally speaking .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Cuando vamos.</span><br>Good. La vemos cuando vamos. But, if we want to say we will see her when we go, and we're referring to the future, not generally. We will see her when we go. How will that be? So, we will see her, we can just use the present because when we go is the future context. So, again how is we will see her? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>La vemos.</span><br>Good. When we go, and we refer now to the future with when we go .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Cuando vayamos.</span><br>Good. La vemos cuando vayamos. So, we have la vemos cuando vamos generally, la vemos cuando vayamos in the future.<br>-- end of track --" ]

 [ " Track 74 <br> So we've been seeing the obligatory uses of the mood tense and we will continue to look at some of these uses. To choose is elegir. Elegir. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Elegir.</span><br>Which sounds a little bit like .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Elect.</span><br>Yes, elect. Related to elect. Election in Spanish is elección. I choose from elegir is elijo, elijo. So what happened there? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>The /e/ became /i/.</span><br>Yes, the e or the /e/ sound became an i or an /i/ sound. So instead of splitting, this e just turns into an i. And that happens sometimes in Spanish with a few verbs. When we stress the e, instead of splitting it will just turn into an i. So here we have elijo. And this just when we stress it. So how would you say we choose from elegir? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Elegimos.</span><br>Elegimos. Good. So there the e is not turning into an i because we are not stressing it. Elegimos. But in the other places where we stress it, it will. So we have elijo. You, informal. You choose .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Eliges.</span><br>Eliges. Good. So how would you say I don't want you to choose for me? Now when for means on my behalf, I don't want you to choose for me, I don't want you to choose on my behalf, the for that we use is por. But, maybe we don't mean on my behalf. Maybe we mean I don't want you to choose something for me. Literally something that is for me. So, in that case we would use para. But, let's make the sentence like on my behalf. I don't want you to choose for me. I don't want you to choose on my behalf, speaking informally .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>No quiero que elijas por mí.</span><br>Very good. No quiero que elijas por mí. Good. So por mí is like on my behalf. I don't want you to take my decisions. No quiero que elijas por mí. To break was romper, or romperse if we say something breaks without saying who breaks it. We said that romper was related to rapture in English, which also means it's related to corrupt. The -rupt of corrupt is rupture, disrupt, erupt. <br>So romper is to break. How would you say I don't want it to break? I don't want it to break .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>No quiero que rompa.</span><br>If you say no quiero que rompa I'm waiting to hear what you don't want it to break. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Lo rompa, ah, not lo rompa-</span><br>That would be a different sentence- .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Se rompa.</span><br>Good. If you were to say no quiero que lo rompa, it would mean I don't want him or her to break it, or you (formal) to break it. If you say no quiero que se rompa, we are not saying who. We are just saying I don't want it to break. I don't want it to break itself, even though we don't literally mean itself. We said that we can use para, for, para. We can use para like to, when it's in order to. So when we have a to in English which implies in order to, we should put para in Spanish. What was to find? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Encontrar.</span><br>Encontrar. Encontrarse, encontrarse, to find oneself, is to meet up. To meet up. So how would you say we have met up or we have found ourselves or each other, which is the same word in Spanish? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Hemos. Nos hemos encontrado.</span><br>Good. Nos hemos encontrado. We have met up. So we have met up in order to speak. We have met up to speak. We have met up in order to speak .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>So, nos hemos encontrado para hablar.</span><br>Good. Nos hemos encontrado para hablar. Good. So we have met up to speak. And, although we wouldn't say in order to speak usually in English, if that to speak implies in order to speak then we will put para in Spanish. <br>Nos hemos encontrado para hablar. But after para que, so that, para que, you must use the mood tense. We have cooked in order that they eat. We have cooked so they eat .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Hemos cocinado para que coman.</span><br>Good. Hemos cocinado para que coman. Good. We have cooked so that they eat. And you can't make the shortcut there, of para comer, hemos cocinado para comer, because of course it would just sound like we have cooked in order to eat, in order for us to eat. Good. To go back or to return is volver. Volver. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Volver.</span><br>Volver, like in revolve. The -volve of revolve is volver and exists in Spanish, revolver. But in Spanish, revolver means to stir. Revolver. So volver is to return or to go back or to come back. How do you think you would say I return? I come back or go back .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Volvo. Vuelvo.</span><br>Vuelvo. Good. The o splits. Vuelvo. How would you say you come back or you go back, speaking informally? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Vuevles.</span><br>Volver. Take it slowly. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Vuelves.</span><br>Good. Vuelves. Now if you say so that you come back, in order for you to come back, so that you come back .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Para que vuelvas.</span><br>Good. Para que vuelvas. So you could say something like I've done it so that you come back. I've done it so that you come back. So I have done: the version of hacer after haber, after any version of haber is hecho. It's very irregular. And we said that hecho, the version of hacer after haber, also means fact. So I have done, how is it? I have done .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>He hecho.</span><br>Good. I have done it so that you come back, informally .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Lo han hecho para que volvamos.</span><br>Good. Lo han hecho para que volvamos. They have done it so that we come back. And I should mention that you might hear para shortened down in Spanish to pa. So para que would sound like pa que, pa que volvamos. How much this happens or if it happens at all depends on dialect. So you will notice it if you hear pa, it's just para. What was the word for so, like in so tired? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Tan.</span><br>Tan. And también, t-a-m-b-i-e-n is as well, also. And it actually has tan inside there. The n turned to an m because of that b, it softened it. So we have tan and then bien. También. Just like in English as well. Tan, other than so, can also be translated as as in certain circumstances and then well, from as well, bien. So interestingly they are like direct translations of each other. Even though if you think about it the direct translation doesn't make any sense: as well. But it's the same in English and Spanish. As well, también. So how would you say so that you too, so that you as well come back, and let's speak informally? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Para que tú también vuelvas.</span><br>Good. Para que tú también vuelvas or para que vuelvas tú también. So how would you say we have done everything, we have done everything, so that you also come back? We have done everything so that you also come back .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Donde quieres.</span><br>Donde quieres. Good. Now if we want to say wherever you want, then to get wherever actually we can change the verb to the mood tense and that changes the feeling of where. And then where turns into wherever.

 [ " <span class='ans'>Donde queras.</span><br>I want to hear well though the i and the e in quieras. .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Hazlo como te guste.</span><br>Hazlo como te guste. In English we are changing how to however and in Spanish we are changing te gusta to te guste. Hazlo como te guste. How would you say do what you prefer? Do what you prefer. Still informal .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Haz lo que preferes.</span><br>And .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Prefieres.</span><br>Very good. Haz lo que prefieres. So what we are investigating here is an optional use of the mood tense, no? Because haz lo que prefieres is perfect Spanish. It just means do what you prefer. But if you want to give the meaning do whatever you prefer how will you change that? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Haz lo que prefieras.</span><br>Good. Haz lo que prefieras. Do whatever you prefer. Eat whatever you prefer. Eat whatever you prefer, speaking informally .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Comes lo que prefieras.</span><br>Comes lo que prefieras would be you eat whatever you prefer. Comes lo que prefieras, which is a way of saying it. You could say it like this. Comes lo que prefieras. It just sounds actually a little sweeter. You eat whatever you prefer, rather than eat whatever you prefer. But, here we are working with the order. We have a shortcut where we are not using the mood tense, what is it? We have comes, you eat. And what do we do to get the order? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Come.</span><br>Come. Good. So making the order, even though your sentence was very nice and very sweet, comes lo que prefieras. Let's make it an order. Eat whatever you prefer .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Come lo que prefieras.</span><br>Very good. Come lo que prefieras. Now make this formal. Eat whatever you prefer, but speaking formally .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Coma lo que prefiera.</span><br>Very good. So here we have two mood tenses. We have coma which is the order and then prefiera, giving us whatever from what. Coma lo que prefiera. What if you were speaking to more than one person? Eat whatever you prefer .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Coman lo que prefieran.</span><br>Good. Coman lo que prefieran. Good. What was to need in Spanish? Sounding more like to necessitate. .." ] ,

So we could say something like I'll follow you wherever you go. So, we can say I will follow you or we can just use the present I follow you. Because, the wherever you go is a future context informally. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Te sigo.</span><br>Te sigo. Good. Wherever you go. So this is actually to wherever you go. Wherever you go to, to wherever you go. So how would you say to where? .." ] ,

And you specify with your subjectivity this thing that we don't know if it exists or not, this somebody that speaks Spanish, and you do that with this que structure: Is there somebody here that speaks Spanish, then here you will use the mood tense, this subjective tense. So, how would you say that? Is there somebody here that speaks Spanish? .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Hay dos personas aquí.</span><br>That speak Spanish .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Que hablan español.</span><br>Very good. Hay dos personas aquí que hablan español. Very good. The past of hay is había, which shows us, actually, that hay comes from haber. It's a very weird historic version of haber. But había, we see more clearly, that it comes from haber. Now, había doesn't change either, so you will have to resist the temptation to say habían when you want to say there were instead of there was, no? It's always había, doesn't change. Hay doesn't change for there is or there are, and había doesn't change for there was or there were. So, how would you say There were two people that spoke Spanish? Now, this is an interesting sentence, because in English we will use the point in the past, there were two people that spoke Spanish, but what do you think we will use in Spanish, the point or the line? .." ] ,

So, it makes sense for it to be the line in the past, because what we are referring to here is the fact they were Spanish-speakers, and they weren't Spanish-speakers just for that moment, were they? So if we look at it and we think about which one fits better, we will choose the line, so again, it's a great example that we don't want to take a direct translation from English, from spoke, we want to just look at the context and decide if it makes sense to use the line or the point. So, give me this sentence - there were two people here that spoke Spanish .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Había dos personas aquí que hablaban español.</span><br>Good. Había dos personas aquí que hablaban español. If we were to use the point here – que hablaron español – we wouldn't be talking about the fact that they are Spanish-speakers, but rather that they spoke Spanish at that time, whatever time we are referring to. We said that hay, there is or there are; or había, there was or there were; comes from haber in fact. So, when we say something like there has to be something, and with this be we mean exist, there has to exist something, this be is actually coming from there is/there are, not from to be. It's coming from this invisible verb that we do not have in English, which we make up for by using there is/there are. So, when we say something like there has to be something that you can eat, there must be something that you can do, this be is exist, there must exist something, in which case it's haber. It's not ser and it's not estar, and if you try to think which one it is, ser or estar, you will be a long time trying to work out which one it is. So, how would you say this sentence? There has to be something that you can do (let's speak informally). There has to be something that you can do. <br>You can use has to or must, doesn't make a lot of difference here. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Tiene que hay-</span><br>But it's to form, so hay and había come from? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Haber. Tiene que haber.</span><br>Something that you can do .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Algo que puedas hacer.</span><br>Yes, puedas, very good. Tiene que haber algo que puedas hacer. <br>Because here, like before with the example of is there somebody that speaks Spanish, we are speaking about the existence of something when we don't know whether it exists or not, with this structure of hay and que. So, we are seeing that the mood tense has structural limitations, it can occur only in certain places structurally, and at the same time only to give certain meanings or feelings. Now, these meanings or feelings and the fact that Spanish is concerned with us expressing them and perceiving them through the language shows the value system of Spanish, or part of the value system of Spanish. Now different languages have different value systems, what a language requires you to express through it, and then the other things that the language might ignore might be considered its value system. And languages, like cultures and individuals, have things they value, things they pay attention to and things they don't, which is what makes something like the mood tense so incredibly interesting to analyze and observe and use. So again, not something we want to be obsessed about getting correct, it really is something that we want to feel and also understand logically through our exposure and use of Spanish. We should also bear in mind that the use of the subjunctive or the mood tense can change slightly depending on dialect and also idiolect, which is the individual dialect of each person. So, we want to look out for it, listen actively, analyze and enjoy the journey of understanding it and also using it and the different possibilities of expression that that gives us. It will be a very fascinating insight into the value system of this particular language.<br>-- end of track --" ]

 [ " Track 77 <br> How would you say there should be something to eat? There should be something to eat - so, we said that should was would owe or would must, so what is to owe, which we can use like must and it's related to debt? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Deber.</span><br>Deber. And would must or would owe gives us the meaning should. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Debería.</span><br>Good. There should be something to eat .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Debería haber.</span><br>Good. Your first place your mind is going to go is to choose between ser and estar. If neither fit, make that little check, 'oh, is this exist? Is this the be that means exist?' And then you know it's haber. So, there should be, there should exist something to eat .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Debería haber algo comer- para comer.</span><br>Good, in order to eat, there should be something in order to eat, good. Debería haber algo para comer, there should be something to eat. Very good. Another common place that we use the mood tense in Spanish, is when we say it is, an adjective, que, and then a verb. This verb is going to go into the mood tense, you are noticing that que has a lot to do with the subjunctive, that this que introduces the mood tense in many cases. So, for example, if I want to give you some advice and tell you it's terrible that you eat this, it is terrible that you eat this. So, let's speak informally .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Es terrible que comas esto.</span><br>Good. Es terrible que comas esto. Good. So, it's the que, the combination of es terrible and que, which introduces this mood tense. If you say it is terrible if you eat this, then you don't use the mood tense. So, how would you say that? It is terrible if you eat this, still speaking informally .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Es terrible si comes esto.</span><br>Good. Es terrible si comes esto. How would you say it is possible? .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Es posible que vayamos más tarde.</span><br>Good. Es posible que vayamos más tarde. Fuerte in Spanish means strong, but it's also used colloquially and maybe the closest translation that I can think of would be something like, I mean, again it's very colloquial, but you can say oh, that's hardcore, that's full-on, in Spanish you say a lot qué fuerte, qué fuerte, how heavy, how hardcore, how full-on, qué fuerte. And we see that we can use qué like how – qué fuerte; qué lindo, how nice, how beautiful; qué bueno, how good. You can say qué increíble que or qué fuerte que, so, whilst we have two que's there in Spanish, this is just how incredible that, how hardcore that, and, of course, we will carry on into the mood tense. So, how strong, how heavy, that he is here, how would you say that? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Qué fuerte que esté aquí.</span><br>Good. Qué fuerte que esté aquí. In English we achieve a similar feeling to what we get with the Spanish subjunctive sometimes with words like should or might. Here for example, in English we could say how incredible that he should come, here we don't mean should, like in its literal meaning like debería, no, here in English we are using should to give this kind of mood tense feeling: how incredible that he should come. Está bien, está bien, means it's okay. The literal translation of bien is well, and to be well is a state, so it goes with estar: está bien, but it can also be used like it's okay. So for example, you could say, you know, it's okay that you ask but I don't have to reply. So, to ask is preguntar, and to reply or to respond is responder. So, we will say it's okay that you ask, but it's not necessary that I respond, I don't need to respond, it's not necessary that I respond. So, the first bit – it's okay that you ask, and we are speaking informally, and to ask was preguntar .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Está bien que preguntes.</span><br>Good. Está bien que preguntes. So, it's like okay, you can ask as much as you like, so this is the feeling we get here with the mood tense, or in English we might use might here to get this kind of mood tense feeling: it's okay that you might ask. But .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>No es necesario que responda.</span><br>Very good. Está bien que preguntes, pero no es necesario que responda. And there we have the mood tense after es necesario, or no es necesario que, so we have it is, adjective, que, and then the verb, and that verb with the mood tense. We also could have said no hace falta que responda, it doesn't make lack, this common expression we said that we will hear around, hacer falta, no hace falta que responda. How would you say it is important that we find it soon? It's important that we find it soon .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Es probable que siga hablando.</span><br>Very good. Es probable que siga hablando. Good. It is probable that he continues speaking. So, after seguir to get the meaning of continue we can use the -ing. What was to be for characteristics? .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Es imperativo que siga siendo gratis.</span><br>Good. Es imperativo que siga siendo gratis. To start, we said that we had comenzar and empezar.

How would you say it's spectacular that they start to speak Spanish? Now, after start, to connect to the next to form you need a. There are just a handful of verbs that are not verbs of movement, for example, like ir, volver, salir, that need a to connect, apart from these there are just a handful of verbs that use some preposition to connect, and empezar and comenzar are two of them. So, how would you say it's spectacular that they begin to speak Spanish (spectacular is the same word in Spanish)? .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Oh, right, espectacular.</span><br>Good, es espectacular, that they begin .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Que comienzen a hablar español.</span><br>Good. Es espectacular que comienzen a hablar español. It's spectacular that they start to speak Spanish. Now, after comenzar and empezar you could also put the -ing form, and the meaning would change a little, it would mean it's spectacular that they start out speaking Spanish. Now, in English there is not a lot of difference, that they begin to speak Spanish, that they begin speaking Spanish, both in English mean to start speaking Spanish. But in Spanish, if you use the -ing here it would mean that they start out speaking Spanish, like right from the beginning. So, when I'm speaking about these courses for example, I say that we start out speaking Spanish, right from the beginning. Now, speaking about that in Spanish I would use the -ing here. So, it's spectacular that they start out speaking Spanish .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Es espectacular que comienzen hablando español.</span><br>Good. And here we don't need the a, because we are not connecting to a to form. What was the verb to finish or to terminate? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Terminar.</span><br>Terminar. Now, if you want to say a sentence like I want you guys to speak with me when you finish selling them, we will say when you finish to sell them. Here you won't use the -ing, but to finish, terminar, is also one of those verbs that needs a preposition to connect to the next to form. In this case the preposition is de. So, to finish selling them is terminar de vender. So, I want you guys to speak with me when you finish selling them, so the first bit is I want you guys to speak with me, how is that bit? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Quiero que hablen conmigo.</span><br>Good, mood tense, quiero que hablen conmigo. Good. I want that you talk with me, quiero que hablen conmigo, when you finish selling them. So, when you finish, and we are still speaking to you guys .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Cuando terminen,</span><br>Good, why did you use the mood tense there – cuando terminen? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Because it's the future when.</span><br>Good. When cuando refers to generally, we won't use the mood tense, we just use the present, and here, referring to a future event that hasn't happened, after cuando, we use the mood tense, well remembered. Quiero que hablen conmigo cuando terminen, when you finish selling them, and we are not going to use selling, we are going to use to sell, and we connect that with de .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Cuando terminen de venderlos.</span><br>Good, so altogether – I want you guys to speak with me when you finish selling them .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Quiero que hablen conmigo cuando terminen de venderlos.</span><br>Good. Quiero que hablen conmigo cuando terminen de venderlos. <br>So this means I want you guys to speak with me when you finish selling them, but terminar we can also use like end up: I want you guys to speak with me when you end up selling them. So, using the -ing form after terminar, instead of de and the to form, gives us this meaning of 'end up'. So, if you wanted to say, I want you guys to speak with me when you end up selling them, so I want you guys to speak with me .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Quiero que hablen conmigo.</span><br>When you end up selling them, so we will say when you finish and then we will actually use the -ing .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Cuando terminen vendiéndolos.</span><br>Good. Quiero que hablen conmigo cuando terminen vendiéndolos. I want you guys to speak with me when you end up selling them. So, there is a difference here, depending on whether we use the to form or the -ing form, just as we saw with empezar or comenzar, there can be a difference between using the to form afterwards or the -ing form afterwards, and both of them need a preposition to join the to form, which might be a clue to you that there is a difference between using the to form and then the -ing form. If the to form is joining with a preposition, then maybe this particular verb takes the -ing form afterwards as well with a slightly different meaning. Empezar a hablar, to start to speak, to start speaking; empezar hablando, to actually begin something speaking, or, as we would probably say, to start out speaking; terminar de vender, to finish selling; terminar vendiendo, to end up selling. So, what we have aimed to teach here is the idea of the mood tense, the general feeling of the mood tense, and the kind of constructions in which it occurs, and, like I said, understanding the mood tense is about listening out for it, and listening out for how people around you use it. A great way to learn it is to chat online, for example, because maybe in real life, and almost certainly at the beginning, you won't pick up those subtle changes in vowels that you get with the mood tense. But if you are chatting online you will notice quite clearly, 'ah, there they used an a and not an e, or there they used an e and not an a, oh why?' And then you will look at the context of the sentence and work out why the mood tense was used and that really is the best way to internalize it.<br>-- end of track --" ]

 [ " <span class='ans'>Ojalá.</span><br>You will hear it a lot, ojalá, and there are a lot of versions of the history of where it came from. What it's definitely got something to do with is 'Allah', the Arabic word for God, or the god, Allah, and the south of Spain was part of the Muslim world for around eight centuries, so we have a lot of Arabic words and structures and habits in Spanish, and one of them is this popular expression ojalá. And there are a lot of versions of where it came from exactly, although my favorite is that it's a contraction of 'ojo-Allah', ojo means eye, and it's still used in some places, like watch out! Ojo! Careful, watch it, beware, so it's like 'ojo-Allah', so you say it when you want something, 'ojo-Allah', I want this, ojalá, hopefully. Although that's just one version of where ojalá came from. So, after ojalá you can use the mood tense to say what you want to happen, so, you can say for example, hopefully she will leave a message, or she leaves a message, using your mood tense. Hopefully she leaves a message .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Ojalá deje un mensaje.</span><br>Good, ojalá deje un mensaje. How would you say hopefully it will be soon?

It's something that you should enjoy and analyze and the most interesting areas might be the optional uses, because with the optional uses of the mood tense you can really give many different tones to what you are saying, whether it's humor, or sarcasm, or sincerity, irritation – there is a whole spectrum of feelings you can express with it.

We have sé as a verb, yo sé, from saber, I know, and this sé is written with a written accent sé or yo sé, or we said lo sé is very common, I know it, just because sé, sé, sé is a little short, so you might hear lo sé, lo sé, lo sé, I know it.

And then we also had a se which was when we have two /l/'s together – the first one, the personal one will turn into se only because Spanish doesn't like phonetically the sound of having these two /l/'s together.

 [ " <span class='ans'>Volver.</span><br>Volver. Good. Volver. Instead of saying otra vez, another way of saying again in Spanish is to use volver. So, for example, it closes again, we can say vuelve a cerrarse. It returns to close. Why do we have a here? Vuelve a cerrarse? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Because it's a verb of movement.</span><br>Good. So how would you say I don't want the door to close again, with volver, how would it be? <br>So let's take it from the beginning. I don't want that .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>No quiero que.</span><br>The door returns .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>La puerta vuelva.</span><br>Very good. To close itself .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>A cerrarse.</span><br>Good. No quiero que la puerta vuelva a cerrarse. Or no quiero que vuelva a cerrarse la puerta. So volver a can be used like again, and it's very common in Spanish. You might hear it around. So if you say I don't want it to happen again, for to happen you can use to pass. What was to pass? Or if you don't remember, you can make a guess here. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Pasar.</span><br>Pasar. Or occur, ocurrir. You can use that as well, for happen. Suceder, succession, suceder. All of these mean to happen. Pasar is probably easier, and easier to remember. So, I don't want it to happen again. I don't want it to return to happen .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>No quiero que vuelva a pasar.</span><br>Good. No quiero que vuelva a pasar. Good. So we saw that we have the mood tense with which we are switching the vowel, so we go from vuelve to vuelva to get the mood tense. Or we have cerrar and we go from cierra to cierre to get the mood tense. We only have mood tense in the present and in the past. It doesn't exist in the futures. It used to, and there are a couple of words left behind in fixed expressions that still have this form. But for all intents and purposes, it doesn't exist any more in Spanish, the future mood tense. We have the present, which we've practiced and have a very good hold on, and the past mood tense. Now, the past mood tense is very easy to build. We will always build it going from the they form of the point in the past. And now that I've mentioned the point in the past, I should also mention that the mood tense for the past is the same for the line and the point. There are no two different ones. It counts for both. And we build it going from the point in the past for they. So for example, if we take a verb like to speak, hablar, and they spoke .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Is it hablaron?</span><br>Yes, hablaron. So that's the first step to find the mood tense for the past, is to go to the they form for the point in the past, hablaron. So you find hablaron and you change that last o to an a and what do you get? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Hablaran.</span><br>Hablaran. And that is your mood tense for they in the past. Now from that, we can work backwards to find the I, he, she, it, you (formal) version. If we work backwards from hablaran, what would we do to work backwards from hablaran, what would we get rid of? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>The n, hablara.</span><br>Hablara. And then we can make the you (informal) version .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Hablaras.</span><br>Good. And we, and the accent won't move. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Habláramos.</span><br>Habláramos. Good. So that's your set. We can do the same now with comer. What was they ate, the point in the past? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Comieron.</span><br>Comieron, good. So now give me the mood tense version of they ate .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Comieran.</span><br>Comieran. Good. And I ate, he, she, it, you (formal) ate .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Comiera.</span><br>Good. We .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Comiéramos.</span><br>Comiéramos. And you (informal) .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Comieras.</span><br>Comieras. So this is how we form our mood tense in the past. We want to go from the they form. So we use this pretty much in the same kind of situations that we use the present mood tense. Just in the past, with a couple of situations that are specifically for past. So for example, where quiero que necessitates the mood tense in the present, quería que, I wanted that, will necessitate the mood tense in the past. What is I wanted, using the line in the past? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Quería.</span><br>So now you could say something like I wanted them to eat with us. I wanted that they ate with us. And that they ate of course will be in the mood tense. I wanted that they ate with us .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Quería que comieran con nosotros.</span><br>Good. Quería que comieran con nosotros. And as we said, point in the past, line in the past, when it comes to the mood tense, it's the same. I was hoping that he would call me. I was hoping .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Esperaba que.</span><br>That he would call me. So, I was hoping that, we don't say would, we use the past mood tense again. I was hoping that he called me .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Esperaba que me llamara.</span><br>Good. Esperaba que me llamara. So whilst in English we would say I was hoping that he would call me, in Spanish I was hoping that he called me, and we use the past mood tense. Esperaba que me llamara. Good. What was to need or to necessitate? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Necesitar.</span><br>Good. Necesitar. How would you say we needed, using the line in the past? We needed, we were needing .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Necesitábamos.</span><br>Good. Necesitábamos. How would you say we needed to speak with him? We needed to speak with him .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Necesitábamos que-</span><br>Why que? We needed to speak .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Necesitábamos hablar.</span><br>With him .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Con él.</span><br>Good. So here we don't need the mood tense. Necesitábamos hablar con él. We needed to speak with him. But, if you were to say we needed that he speak with us, we needed that he spoke with us, then this that, this que is what most of the time in Spanish is alerting you that maybe you want to use the mood tense. So, we needed that he speak with us, how is that? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Necesitábamos que hablara con nosotros.</span><br>Very good. Necesitábamos que hablara con nosotros. Very good. What was to return, and we said that we can also use this verb like again? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Volver.</span><br>Volver. So if I wanted to say I called you again, I could just say I returned to call you. It's got nothing to do with actually returning, ah? It's just a way of saying again. So what is I returned, from to return, from volver .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Volvá.</span><br>Go back to comer .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Volví.</span><br>Good. So I called you again, speaking informally .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Volví a llamarte.</span><br>Good. Volví a llamarte. To organize. In order to organize .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Para organizar.</span><br>Good. So all together, I called you again in order to organize, speaking informally .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Volví a llamarte para organizar.</span><br>Good. Volví a llamarte para organizar. So, if we have para organizar, we don't need to worry about the mood tense. And we can sometimes adjust our sentence, putting to forms so that we can avoid finding the mood tense. So you could say something like volví a llamarte para organizar, volví a llamarte para organizar, I called you again in order to organize, and there you don't need the mood tense. But if you were to say I called you again so that, in order that, we organized, then there you would have to use the mood tense. So how would that be? I called you again, informally still .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Volví a llamarte.</span><br>So that .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Para que.</span><br>We organized. So it's the mood tense now, in the past .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Organizaron. Organizaran. Organizáramos.</span><br>Very good. Very good. So you have to take a trip through, ah, to find it. And it's quite time consuming at the beginning. But once you start practicing this past mood tense, of course it becomes much quicker to find these different forms. Volví a llamarte para que organizáramos. And like I said, you can even avoid the use of the mood tense just by saying volví a llamarte para organizar, in a structure like this one, for example. So we're seeing that there are similar structures to the structures we practiced the mood tense in the present with, just in the past.<br>-- end of track --" ]

[
 [ " Track 82<br> We also said that when we use ser or estar, with an adjective plus que - so for example, es relevante que, it's relevant that, está bien que, it's okay that - we will follow this up with the mood tense. So how would you say for example, it's not very relevant that they found it, it's not very relevant that they found it, for example? So how is it's not very relevant .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>No es muy relevante.</span><br>Good. That they found it .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Que encontraron, encontraran, lo encontraran.</span><br>Good. No es muy relevante que lo encontraran. So here we're not starting with the past, are we? No es muy relevante. That's the present. But after que we refer back to the past, so we can use the past mood tense. In the same way, we could use the present mood tense. We could say it's not very relevant that they find it, that they might find it, using the present mood tense. So how would that sound? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>No es muy relevante que lo encuentren.</span><br>Good. No es muy relevante que lo encuentren. Good. How would you say it wasn't very relevant? Now, the line (we can use the line in the past here) from ser is irregular. But, we can remember the word era in English, to remember this line in the past from ser. Because a line in the past is an era, and if we pronounce era as if it was Spanish, we get .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Era.</span><br>Era. And that's the line in the past from ser. So how would you say it was very relevant? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Era muy relevante.</span><br>Good. It was very relevant that they found it. It was very relevant that they found it .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Era muy relevante que lo encontraran.</span><br>Good. So, we want to identify the structures that allow us to use the mood tense, other than to use the mood tense correctly, to also avoid it sometimes. No? <br>So imagine you're having a conversation and you just want to get the meaning across and the point across, and maybe you don't want to worry in that moment about finding the mood tense. You just have something you need to say, and you will worry about it later how it would be with the mood tense. So we can play around with the structure as we did, for example, with volví a llamarte para organizar. I called you again to organize, instead of volví a llamarte para que organizáramos. I called you again so that we organized. Like we did there, we can play around a little bit with the structure to avoid using the mood tense. So for example, instead of saying es importante que, we could also say the important thing is that. And when we say the important thing is that, what we end up with is es que. So, we said that we have a useful structure we can use to give this the important thing. So instead of saying la cosa importante, which would be a literal translation of the important thing, how could we make that structure using lo? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Just say lo importante?</span><br>Yes, lo importante. Good. So we said that instead of saying literally the important thing, you can just use lo. With any adjective, and you get this idea of the important thing. Lo importante, the important thing. Lo increíble, the incredible thing. Lo espectacular, the spectacular thing. Es que, and then after that es que, you don't need any mood tense. So, incredible is increíble, slightly different in Spanish than in English. We don't have the d, and we can actually see where incredible comes from. To believe in Spanish was creer. And creíble would be believable. And increíble is unbelievable. So incredible actually means unbelievable. Increíble. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Increíble.</span><br>So first, if we say it's incredible that, then we will want the mood tense. So, it's incredible that they come back, that they return. What was to return? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Volver.</span><br>Volver. Good. So, it's incredible that they return, that they come back .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Es increíble que vuelvan.</span><br>Good. Es increíble que vuelvan. But, if you wanted to avoid going through that, you could just say the incredible thing is that they come back. And there you don't need the mood tense. So, the incredible thing .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Lo increíble.</span><br>Is that they return .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Es que vuelven.</span><br>Good. Lo increíble es que vuelven. The incredible thing is that they come back. How would you say the incredible thing is that they do it again? And we will use the structure with volver to say again. So, the incredible thing is that they return to do it. What was to do or to make? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Hacer.</span><br>Good. The incredible thing is that they do it again. The incredible thing is that they return to do it .." ] ,

So if we wanted to say something like that you bought it is not my problem, that you might have bought it is not my problem, the fact that you bought it is not my problem, we can just start with que and put the verb in the mood tense, and we get this feeling. The fact that you may have bought it. We're doing the same thing in English - may have - with this may we are getting some mood. So, let's start. Speaking informally, that you bought it, that you may have bought it .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>No es mi problema.</span><br>Good. Que lo compraras no es mi problema. Maybe you want to say something like, that you told him is not my problem. So, to tell we can use decir, to tell or to say, or contar we saw as well. Contar means to count or to recount. So let's use contar. That you told him, the fact that you told him, is not my problem. Speaking informally still .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Que contaras. Que le contaras no es mi problema.</span><br>Que le contaras no es mi problema. Good. In English I should say - although I have this London English so often I don't say - I should say if I were you. Now I was is the normal past tense, from to be. <br>I was. So we change was to were to get the past mood tense in English. If I were you, hypothetical past. In Spanish whenever we speak about the past hypothetically, after si, after if, we will use the mood tense. So for example, what was the verb to be able to, can, related to power? .." ] ,

Si lo viera, lo entendería. I should mention that there also exists an alternative form for the past mood tense: the past subjunctive, with -ase or -iese. So you may hear hablase instead of hablara, or entendiese instead of entendiera, comiese instead of comiera, comiésemos instead of comiéramos. But how much that alternative form is used really depends on the dialect. The main way, the most common way of using the past subjunctive is the one that we've learned here. And there's no difference between the two in meaning. They are just two versions of the same tense. So you don't need to worry about using hablase instead of hablara for example, but you will need to recognize it if you hear it or read it somewhere.<br>-- end of track --" ]

 [ "Track 84<br> So now we really do have the panorama of all times and moods in Spanish. So now that's everything. That's every tense including both the idea of time and the idea of mood. We've learned how to construct them all, and we should really listen actively to refresh any knowledge that we might need to refresh through our exposure to Spanish. Analyzing always what we hear, and if you're listening to a song or a movie maybe you just hear the endings of the verbs at the beginning. But if you can identify what that ending means, that's the important bit. In the same way this course has been focused equally on the process that we go through in building our structures in Spanish, as it has been focused on content. So half of the point of this course has been content, has been teaching you Spanish; and the other half has been how to manage Spanish, how to manage these elements that we've learned. How to think about this information and how to relate to information generally in a new way. How to find things that you think you might have forgotten. We've also looked now and then at some irregularities in Spanish. Verbs or other words that don't follow the rules that we learned. Now the older the language, the more irregularities it tends to have. Spanish, effectively being modern Latin, is quite prone to irregularities. But the irregularities can be made sense of within themselves. You can group together irregularities. So whilst throughout the course we were looking at the odd irregularity as it popped up, now at the end of the course we are going to tidy up the irregular verbs. So there are a group of verbs, which we can call the 'go verbs'. These are the verbs that use -go instead of -o for the I form. For example, how do you say to have, to have, for possession? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Tener.</span><br>Tener. And I have .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Tengo.</span><br>Tengo. So this -go pops up for the I version, but only for the I version. How do you say he has, or she has, you (formal) have? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Tiene.</span><br>Tiene. And you (informal) .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Tienes.</span><br>And they .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Tienen.</span><br>Tienen. And we .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Tenemos.</span><br>Tenemos. So the -go is only popping up for the I version. What was to come? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Venir.</span><br>Venir. Good. I come .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Vengo.</span><br>Vengo. So here we have the -go again. But he comes .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Viene.</span><br>Viene. They come .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Vienen.</span><br>You (informal) .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Vienes.</span><br>We .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Venemos- venimos.</span><br>Venimos. Good. So we have this -go popping up just for the I form. We've seen other verbs like this. What was to go out or to leave? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Salir.</span><br>Salir. And I go out or I leave .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Salgo.</span><br>Salgo. To put .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Poner.</span><br>Poner. And I put .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Pongo.</span><br>Pongo. Good. We have decir, to say or to tell and we get digo, which is even more irregular but we see the -go. We have hacer, to make or to do, and we get hago. Oír, which means to hear, oír. And we have oigo, I hear. Traer, traer means to bring. And I bring is traigo. So, to bring is t-r-a-e-r, traer, and then I is traigo. It takes an extra i. So here we get traigo. Traer is interesting because traer means to bring. But when it forms part of another verb, we can translate it like -tract. For example, extraer means .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Extract.</span><br>Good. How would you say attract? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Atraer.</span><br>Atraer. Contract .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Contraer.</span><br>Distract .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Distraer.</span><br>Good. I distract .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Distraigo.</span><br>Distraigo. I distract. Or you could say I get distracted. Me distraigo. Good. So these -go verbs are a little bit special and they behave quite irregularly. But more or less in the same way. One of the things they do in the same way is that in the mood tense, instead of switching vowels like the rest of the verbs do in the mood tense in the present, they go from -go to -ga. So whilst in the normal present this -go only pops up for I, we have tengo/tiene/tienes/tienen/tenemos, the -ga for the mood sense is for everybody. So we get tenga for I, he/she/it and you formal. How would you make it informal? .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Quiero que.</span><br>Good. Now we want you come and we want the mood tense version. So it's a -go verb, so our base for the mood tense is venga. So if you want to speak informally and say I want that you come, I want you to come .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Quiero que vengas.</span><br>Very good. Quiero que vengas. And you will hear actually in Spain venga, venga, venga. They use it all the time, meaning come on, come on. Venga vale. They say vale as well in Spain. Venga vale. You will hear this all the time. When a Spanish person is hanging up the telephone you can hear fifteen of them, venga vale, vale venga, venga vale. So this venga that you will hear around a lot will be a nice hook to remember that this -go goes to -ga. Actually, when somebody is answering the phone in Spain, you might hear diga or dígame. What does that mean, dígame? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Tell me.</span><br>Yes. The mood tense by itself is an order. For a positive order then we have the me after the verb, dígame. So you will hear people answering the phone like this in Spain. Tell me. Dígame. So traer was to bring. What is I bring? .." ] ,

So if I want to tell you to eat I can just say come, I go to comes and I drop the s, come. If I want to tell you to find it I can go to encontrar, encuentras, I can drop the s, encuéntralo. That's our shortcut for informal positive commands where we don't use the mood tense. With these -go verbs, to make that shortcut you just drop the -go, so for example, how do you say I have from tener? .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Téngalo.</span><br>Téngalo. But informally we are not using the mood tense, we have a short cut, it's just different to the short cut we learnt before, the short cut is just dropping the -go, tenlo.

So I should mention that the venga that you hear in Spain as come on is not necessarily formal, it's lost that feeling of formality because its like a fixed expression, so venga, venga you hear all the time, and then ven will sound much more like come, physically come, rather than come on; venga, venga, venga is used like come on.

 [ "Track 86<br> These -go verbs, these verbs that take -go instead of -o for the I version in the present, also behave a little bit strangely in the future tenses. In the will and would tenses. So, we can look at that now, and whilst looking at it, revise the endings that we learned for will and would. So we said that our will endings, what we add on to the to form of the verb to get will, are the same as those very irregular versions of haber in the present. So we can make that connection to help us internalize them. Can you talk me through those will endings? .." ] ,

For example, I will have is tendré. Tendré. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Tendré.</span><br>Tendré. So, of course, it should be 'teneré', but it's tendré. So that last e of tener turns into a d, and we get tendré.

 [ "Track 87<br> Looking at the past tenses, the line in the past and the dot in the past, the line in the past is extremely regular. We only have a few odd irregular verbs for the line in the past.

We had the line in the past of ir, which was a little bit like a mix between the -aba ending that we have for -ar verbs for the line in the past and the -ía ending that we have for -er/-ir verbs in the line in past.

 [ " <span class='ans'>Veo.</span><br>Veo. And this extra e that it keeps for the I form in the present, veo, carries over into the line in the past. So I was seeing, you (formal) were seeing, he/she/it were seeing is veía. .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Veías.</span><br>And they .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Veían.</span><br>Good. So the line in the past is a very safe tense. We just have a few irregular verbs, but for the rest we can be very certain that taking off the -ar and putting -aba, or taking off the -er/-ir and putting -ía is going to give us the result that we want. The point in the past is less regular, less reliable. There are a group of verbs in the dot of the point in the past which are irregular, but they all do something very similar. Now most of the verbs in this group are -go verbs, but not all of them. Now what these verbs do in the point in the past is that firstly, the beginning bit of the verb - so for example, if we have poder - that beginning bit, pod-, changes and we already saw this. We saw, for example, they were able was pudieron. So that pod- changes to pud-. Here it's a little change, but there are more drastic changes with other verbs. So this is the first thing. The base of the verb that is left once we take the endings off changes. Sometimes radically, sometimes a little bit like here from pod- to pud-. The second thing that they do is that they use a mixture of the point endings from -ar verbs and from -er/-ir verbs. They use a mixture of the two endings from both sides, but always the same mixture for each of these irregular verbs. And the third thing they do is to not have the accent on the endings. So firstly, let's revise the point in the past with hablar and comer. Just to refresh what are these endings. So we have hablar to speak, and I spoke is .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Hablé.</span><br>Good. And he spoke or she spoke or you (formal) spoke .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Habló.</span><br>Habló. And then we had to eat which was comer. And I ate .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Comí.</span><br>Comí. And he ate or she ate or you (formal) ate, it ate - habló and then with comer it's .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Comió.</span><br>Comió. Good. Back to hablar. How was we spoke? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Hablamos.</span><br>Hablamos. Good. Same as the present tense. And they spoke .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Hablaron.</span><br>Hablaron. And you (informal) spoke - which in the you (informal) version, we hear that informal s and the informal t in the ending .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Comemos. Comimos.</span><br>Comimos. They ate or you guys ate .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Comieron.</span><br>Comieron. And you (informal) ate .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Comiste.</span><br>Very good. Comiste. So that's the panorama of our dot in the past, but these irregular verbs use a mixture of these two groups for different endings in the point in the past. For example, tener, to have. In the point in the past, the way that ten- changes, that root changes, we said that's the first thing that happens. The ten- of tener becomes tuv-. T-u-v. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Tuv-.</span><br>And I had is tuve. And he/she/it had is tuvo. So we are not accenting the endings. Tuve. Tuvo. So where are these two endings coming from, -e and -o? Are they coming from the -ar verbs or from the -er/-ir verbs? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>-ar.</span><br>Good. So we have tuve and tuvo. So these two endings for I and for he/she/it/you formal come from -ar and the rest come from -er/-ir. So how would you say we had with the point in the past? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Tuvimos.</span><br>Tuvimos. And you (informal) .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Tuviste.</span><br>Tuviste. And they .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Tuvieron.</span><br>Tuvieron. Good. So now that we have worked our way through this one verb, all we need to do for the other ones is to find the base. The irregular base for the verb and then we know what to do with it. What was to be, for states? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Estar.</span><br>Estar. Now I was, the point in the past, from estar is estuve. So it's nice to look at tener and estar together because we have tuve for I had and estuve for I was. .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Estuvieron.</span><br>Estuvieron. Where were you guys? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>¿Dónde estuvieron?</span><br>Good. ¿Dónde estuvieron? So whilst we have these irregular forms, which need a little bit more effort, many times you can just use the line in the past instead. So if you say something like ¿dónde estuviste? - where were you? - and here we're using a point in time, so maybe it sounds like where were you in this precise moment when we needed you?, but even so we could still just use the line in the past to get around this irregular tense. Now we don't want to avoid it forever. Anything that we don't control, of the line which will end up controlling us. Anything we are uncertain of that we don't take the control of, will control us. But, many times you're in a conversation and you don't have time to find that irregular form and maybe you want to worry about it later and check or think about what it was. In that case, you can just turn to the line in the past. ¿Dónde estabas? instead of ¿dónde estuviste? So how would you say I had to go using this point in the past? So how is I had, using the point in the past? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Tuve.</span><br>Good. So I had to go .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Tuve que ir.</span><br>Good. So tuve que ir, you would want to use it if you meant that in one precise moment you know something happened and I had to go: tuve que ir. But, you could also use the line in the past and not have any problem there if you wanted to avoid this irregular tense just to get the meaning across. So you can just say tenía que ir, which is regular, to avoid using this irregular tense. What was to say or to tell? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Decir.</span><br>Decir or contar, but decir we are working with for now. So dec- becomes dij- in the point in the past. Dij-. D-i-j. What is I said? .." ] ,

We said that when we have poner as part of a verb in Spanish, it's -pose in English. Componer, compose. Exponer, expose. Oponer, oppose.

 [ " <span class='ans'>Hicieron.</span><br>Good. Whenever you identify one of these irregular verbs in the point in the past where the base of the verb has changed, then you know what to do with it. That end -o is coming from -ar and then you have -imos, -iste, ieron from -er/-ir. Sometimes the change is subtle. We saw that pod- of poder became pud-.

 [ " <span class='ans'>Traje un traje.</span><br>Traje un traje. Vino con vino. Traje un traje. There's one extra irregular past point to look at. It's extra irregular because it doesn't really follow these rules about what groups it's taking the sounds from, and it's also extra irregular because it is the past for both ser and ir. It is the past for both I was and I went. And this is fui. F-u-i. Fui. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Fui.</span><br>Fui. So fui means I was from ser, point in the past, and it also means I went. So ser and ir in the point in the past, they share a past.

 [ " <span class='ans'>Fuiste.</span><br>Fuiste. Now to make they or you (plural) was or went, we would add on -ieron, but we will find it very difficult to pronounce 'fuieron', 'fuieron'. So the /i/ sound, the i fell away. So how would that sound? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Fueron.</span><br>Fueron. So the i, the /i/ sound, falls away. Fueron. The same thing happens in a couple of other cases too. We have trajeron from traer, to bring. They brought, you guys brought, trajeron. Dijeron, they or you guys said. So a couple of other examples there of that i falling away, just for sound reasons. 'Trajieron', 'dijieron' is kind of difficult to say so it fell away for efficiency: dijeron, trajeron, fueron. So now that we have fueron, we can make the past mood tense. We can say something like if I were you because we always go from the they form of the point in the past. So if they went or they were is fueron, we can say if I were you and of course we're using the mood tense here because we have if going into the past hypothetically. So this is a mood tense that is quite specific for the past. We are not putting the mood tense after si, after if in the present. But for this hypothetical past, if I were you, there we have it in English as well as in Spanish. We said that if I were you instead of 'if I was you' is mood tense in English. So how would that be? If I were you .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Tú.</span><br>Tú or usted depending on who we're talking to. So si yo fuera tú. Si fuera tú or si yo fuera tú, si yo fuera usted, if I were you. Now we are understanding why we went from the they version to find the mood tense in the past. Because going from the they version instead of the to form means that if there is some irregularity, we will transfer that irregularity over into the mood tense. So we went from fueron to fuera and we will go from, for example, dijeron, they spoke, to dijera so we carry over that irregularity of having lost that i. Trajeron, they brought and then trajera for the mood tense. I had was tuve. What was they had or you guys had? .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Si lo tuviera.</span><br>I would tell you. You can use contar. Decir is very irregular for would. So if you don't want to deal with that now, imagine you're in a real life context, you can just go to the more regular verb, which is contar. I would tell you, informally .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Te contaría.</span><br>Good. Si lo tuviera, te contaría, or te lo contaría. I would tell you it. We like to close with this it in Spanish a lot. Si lo tuvieria, te lo contaría, I would tell you it. So we have to do or to make which is hacer, and we said that the root for the point in the past is hic-. H-i-c for the I version. So how would you say I made or I did? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Hice.</span><br>Hice. And they did or they made .." ] ,

 [ " <span class='ans'>Quería que lo hicieran.</span><br>Good. I wanted them to do it. I wanted that they do it. Quería que lo hicieran. How would you say I wanted for us to do it, I wanted that we do it, that we did it? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Quería que lo hiciéramos.</span><br>Good. Well done. Quería que lo hiciéramos. Good. I'm not as interested here in installing, let's say, all of this content, all of these irregular verbs. All I want to give you is an exposure to how they might work. The irregular verbs that you can come across, so that practicing, you can manage them. So you should not be afraid of making mistakes. You should build the verbs how you are used to and if you suspect that this one might be irregular, check. Check with the person that you are speaking to.<br>-- end of track --" ]

 [ "Track 89<br> So in the spirit of looking at irregularities in Spanish and how to deal with them and how to identify them, I wanted to spend a little bit of time speaking about making your own rules. We've taught you a great amount of Spanish for you to be very conversational and reach fluency just through practice and listening in a very short amount of time, if you get practicing. But we haven't looked at every single piece of content of Spanish, of course, but the content that we've looked at has taken from every area of the language in an analytical way which will allow you to make your own rules when you come across things that you don't quite understand whilst you're practicing and exposing yourself to Spanish. So I just want to experiment a little bit in regards to that with you now. So I will present you with some imaginary situations where you see the language behaving in certain ways and I want you to make your own rule. Now it doesn't mean it's necessarily your own. Somebody else might have come up with it before, but that you will figure out for yourself what is going on. So for example, the word for too, as in t-o-o is demasiado. Demasiado. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Demasiado.</span><br>It is a bit of a long word, but if you break it up it's easier to digest. You have de más, of more, -iado. And this is too, t-o-o, as in too many. Actually de más can be used by itself if you say tengo cuatro de más. I have four of more, tengo cuatro de más. It means I have four too many. I have four spare. I have four extra. So demasiado means too. Now imagine you hear these following sentences and I want you to work out what's happening here. Why this word is behaving differently in different circumstances. So you might hear demasiadas casas. You might hear demasiados coches. And you might hear demasiado agresivo, demasiado agresiva, and demasiado agresivos. Again. You might hear demasiadas casas, demasiados coches. Here it's changing from the base form demasiado. Demasiadas casas. Demasiados coches. And then here it's not. Demasiado agresivo. Demasiado agresiva. Demasiado agresivos. So why in one situation is it changing and why in the other situation is it not? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>The only difference I see is that it's related to nouns in the first two examples and in the second two it's related to something descriptive.</span><br>Adjectives. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Adjectives.</span><br>Espectacular. Well done. Brilliant. That's it. We said that identifying what type of word we have will mostly be all we need to do to figure out what's going on. So we understand from this that when demasiado goes with a noun, it will change to match it: demasiadas casas, demasiados coches. But when it goes with an adjective it won't: demasiado agresivo, demasiado agresiva, demasiado agresivos, demasiado agresivas. It's not changing. So we didn't learn that here, but we have been analytical enough of the language for you to figure that out by yourself. So another example for you to figure out what's going on. Now the words ala, wing, agua, water and aula, hole or classroom are all feminine words, but we say el ala, the wing. El agua, the water. And el aula, the classroom. What's going on? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Is it because the first letter of those words is a, and it would be weird to say 'la ala'.</span><br>You have other words that begin with a where you have la at the beginning, for example la alfombra, the carpet. La almohada, the pillow. So you need to find something that's different between la almohada and la alfombra to el agua, el ala, el aula. .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Well, the difference in this case is that it's just two, just two syllables, perhaps.</span><br>That's it. There are two syllables and they begin and end in a. So it's a very specific thing. It's not something that we are really going to spend time on learning here in this course. Because it's very likely as well that you'll forget it. So what we have done throughout this course is given you the analytical skills to work it out by yourself and the confidence to make your own rules. So that's the rule. They are all feminine words, but they take el becuase they are two syllables and they begin and end with a. And we know that they are feminine because we say el agua fria. The cold water. Fria, not frio. So we know they are actually feminine even though they are taking el. One more exercise like this. The word for one is uno. The word for some is alguno. And the word for none is ninguno. So we have uno, alguno, ninguno. One, some, none. So if I tell you how many do you want, you will reply to me uno. Or if you don't want any, ninguno. But if I say one man, how do I say one man or a man? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Un hombre.</span><br>Un hombre. And if I say some man, I say algun hombre. And if I say no man, I say ningun hombre. So we have uno, alguno and ninguno. No quiero ninguno, quiero uno, quiero alguno. But, if I say I want one car, for example. Quiero un coche. Quiero algun coche. No quiero ningun coche. So what's happening there? Why does uno become un and why does alguno become algun? .." ] ,
 [ " <span class='ans'>Because a noun is following.</span><br>Yes, because we have a noun following it and it loses that last o. So uno, alguno, ninguno, become un, algun, ningun. And you would notice that it doesn't happen with the feminine. So we have una mujer, a woman. Alguna mujer, some woman. Ninguna mujer, no woman. So the point is just this, that we need to analyze the language that we are coming across, trying to pick out anything that we don't understand to tackle it so that we control it and we understand what's happening so that that element of the language doesn't control us. Very quickly, thinking in this way you will get over your technical problems in the language. You will solve your technical problems and then when you solve your technical problems in a specific language, then you can start to live freely in that language. And become somebody else in that language that is also you, but somebody else, because you are using this mechanism or this tool which as we've said a few times, permits and obliges you to perceive and express the world in a certain way. But before we can fully take advantage of that, we want to get over our technical difficulties and this is achieved not through memorizing what is correct, but analyzing and understanding what is correct and finding why.<br>-- end of track --" ]

 [ "Track 90<br>There are also some variations that you might come across in dialect. For example, in most of Spain they use le and les whenever they're referring to him or her, or you (formal), or you guys, or they. So instead of lo and la and los and las, they are using le and les, not just to make to him, to her, they will use it always when they're referring to people and not things. So in most of Spain, le veo means I see him or her or you (formal). And lo veo means I see it. But in the great majority of the Spanish speaking world this isn't the case. In most of Spain, you have vosotros, which is the you (plural informal), which is only used in Spain or most of Spain. But again, nowhere in Latin America so that might be something you want to listen out for if you will practice this dialect of Spanish. Many accents have an aspirated s in Spanish so you might hear /ehtá/ instead está. /cómo ehtá/ instead of cómo está. /ehpero/ instead of espero. <br>Around the Río de la Plata, for example, around Montevideo and Buenos Aires and in 30% of the Spanish speaking world, used exclusively or mixed with tú, you also have vos. Vos. Another word for tú. And the verb conjugations might change slightly. So instead of puedes you might hear podés. And because the accent's coming on the end, that o isn't splitting. Podés. Instead of quieres, querés. <br>So you might come across small differences in different dialects of Spanish, but they are minor and you now have all of the know-how and experience to identify and understand them. And if you want, adopt them, you can adopt these differences. It's advisable to speak like the people you are practicing with, because the more you speak like the Spanish that you are hearing, the more you understand. <br>Now if you're talking with people from different Spanish speaking countries, people with different dialects or accents in Spanish, then you might get something like a pan-hispanic accent, let's say, like many native Spanish speakers who move around the Spanish speaking world or spend time with Spanish speakers from different countries also have. You might even find yourself switching between different accents when you are talking with people from different places. Again a phenomenon that we also find occurring amongst native speakers. <br>Ahora hablamos español. Ahora somos hispanohablantes. Now we speak Spanish. Now we are Spanish speakers. Somos hispanohablantes y sólo tenemos que practicar, hablar y analizar para perfeccionar nuestro español. " ] ,
 [ "My advice now for the end of the course is to spend some time practicing, to get out and practice and expose yourself to Spanish as much as possible. And then maybe after a short while of practicing, you might want to repeat the course to refresh and touch up on anything that you might be unsure of, especially having practiced and being solid on so many things it will really free up a lot of mental space to home in on the things that you are more uncertain with. And, in this way, repeating the course might be a little bit like when you watch a good movie twice and on the second time round you have a different experience. <br>The most important thing in this journey of exploring and improving your Spanish is to not to forget to enjoy it, to not obsess with the destination but to enjoy the journey. You are already a Spanish speaker, you should enjoy it. There is a huge variety of literature, music, and cinema coming from Spanish speaking countries, so you can enjoy this and at the same time effectively be studying, but it won't feel like that. And we must bear in mind also that listening is a separate skill. You will hear many things that you could think your way through and say and maybe not understand them. So when you first begin listening, don't be overwhelmed by the fact that you don't understand at the beginning as much as you can speak. All you have to do is insist on analyzing the language that you are exposed to, breaking it up and seeing what you can learn from that and although at the beginning it will seem very fast, once you get in the habit of this analysis and this breaking up of the language in the same way that we were doing when we were building up to create our sentences, in reverse deconstructing what you hear. The more you do this, the more Spanish will slow down. It will slow right down and you'll hear a lot more. So like I said, don't be overwhelmed by not understanding a lot at the beginning, insist, enjoy music, watch movies with subtitles, try to match between the subtitles in English and what you are hearing in Spanish. And just try to match bits and pieces. If you insist with this, very quickly you will notice that you are understanding a lot more and that the language appears to slow right down. <br>Thank you very much for participating in the Language Transfer project just by doing the course. Please share it. Language Transfer is a completely independent and unfunded project, so we don't have any funds for the diffusion of this course. " ] ,
 [ "If this course got to you, it's because somebody shared it, so please do keep sharing and telling people about this way of learning so that they also might enjoy this experience for free. All of our courses are completely free to promote language learning and to allow anybody to have this experience anywhere in the world, but of course the fact that the courses are free doesn't mean that we are immune to the world of monetary economics. <br>We produce courses much slower than what we would like to, due to a lack of funds. So when you donate, actually what you're donating is time that we are then able to spend on the construction, practice, and recording of new courses. If you'd like more information on the Language Transfer project, what we're doing, and why, then check out our website www.languagetransfer.org. <br>We really hope you enjoy using your new language and the new world that it opens up to you.
