# traduciendo
A tool that you can use as part of your language learning .
<br />
You start by importing some text from the language that you are studying.
<br />
Then, as you read the text, you add translations for individual words or phrases that you don't know.
<br />
These translated words can be hidden, displayed individually, or they can all be set to display.
