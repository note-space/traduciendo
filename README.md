# traduciendo
A tool that you can use as part of your language learning .
<br />
This program is not uploaded yet; here is a preview of how it works .. let me know if you're interested.
<br />
You start by importing some text from the language that you are studying.
<br />
Then, as you read the text, you add translations for individual words or phrases that you don't know.
<br />
These translated words can be hidden, displayed individually, or they can all be set to display.
<br />
In this sample text, I am translating Spanish into English.
<br />
However, the program can be used for any language .. the program doesn't start with any knowledge; it is all built up by you.
